WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.666
I do. I have seen it 4-5 times
but I'm not scared.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.916
the way people call it to be.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.791
In short, if there's a ghost
this pointer will start moving.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
Hey! Hey!
What is it now?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
I'm doing this research
for my novel.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Are you saying it is not true?
- Are you saying it is true?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It may walk. It'll walk.
I have seen it myself.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.416
By the time I woke up,
she was dead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.375
As though she is near me.
As though she is touching me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
One night, when I woke up,
I saw her on my bed..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.291
You are not scared. Are you?
- No.. No.. Continue..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.875
There is no problem here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.625
Of course, I have seen her.
But now, I'm used to it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
I even tried talking to her
once. But she didn't respond.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.125
such thoughts
are bound to occur.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.291
"Gotta make it fit
like the rhythm of need."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.208
"Darn straight
but still, of late no will"

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Dear, there are few matters
which if you don't know

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
In our present situation..
Now.. This..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
Did you realize it now that we
don't have anyone's support?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.375
Dude!
Take it and go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
Have this.
Come on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Why is he looking
so serious now?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
but hesitant
when it comes to commitment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.041
Boss! We have been in love
since our school days.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.083
Michael! You say you will
marry only her whenever it be.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.916
You are correct.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.666
Dumb fellow! Foolish monkey!
You idiot! Fool! Stupid dog..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
How is it?
- No.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.166
accept me as your better half.
Whole.. Heartedly..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
"Even the bamboo tree
will give you a kiss".

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.875
Hey, wife!
- Tell me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.125
"In the flower bed,
you talk about the silence".

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
"Love... In loneliness,
you gave me love".

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
"With your love,
I dream a lot in my mind".

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
"Your life and its music..."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
"she is the breeze
and she is the sweet smell".

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
I must get that parcel.
Hey!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
Okay, here. Go home
and give this file to Laskshmi.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
What is happening there?
- Come back. Come back.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Why do you put this small girl
through suffering? Very bad.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.125
Priya! Priya! Priya!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.208
What should be done so that
you don't trouble her anymore?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
'How?'

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Michael!
Home delivery. Be quick.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.208
Sir, I'm on a delivery errand.
If you want, Pandy can..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.958
What happened to him?
Tell me what the matter is.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
Stop crying and say
what happened? Speak. Speak up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.125
"The fresh air uttered
my name and I heard it now".

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.208
Sorry, ma'am.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.833
"Cheating..
Cheating.."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.041
"Cheating..
Cheating.. Heart is too rough."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.375
Give it to me.
I will put it in the hot bag.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
What happened?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.333
"It's shocking; this heart
desires to unite with you."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.833
- Sir! Sir! It's locked
from inside. - Smita!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Sir, I am trapped. - I am
asking you. Who are you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.208
Oh, no!
Sorry, sir..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Please save me, sir!
I am innocent. Please! Please!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Sir? - The second room
on the right. Did you go?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
Open the first draw.
What did you find?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.416
Hey! How did you
get this number?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.291
Did you call on my mobile?
Are you talking to that number?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
Please believe, Anu!
I am trapped in a house.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.375
Who is that? Who is that?
- Sir! Sir!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Hey!
- Sir! Sir!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
We found an intruder inside.
No, sir. He looks like..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.541
He is talking
like a mental case, sir.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Sir, where is Anu?
- Who?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.708
Asking me to keep it inside,
she went upstairs to get cash.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
Sir, what had happened
in this house?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.291
How did you enter this place?
- Sir, I'm telling the truth.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
What is her name?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
You kept repeating a girl's name
again and again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.291
How are you related to her?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.291
Husband. Recently.
Few days back, we got married.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.541
Sit down.
Sit down!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Murder. She was pregnant
at that time. - No.. No..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.291
Only one bike is standing.
I think that must be his bike.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
After doing all this,
why are you crying like a saint?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
I'll talk to him.
- Listen to us. - Hey!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Leave him.
Leave him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Don't, sir..
Don't, sir.. Don't, sir..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.083
Okay. I will.
Where is your bag?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Sir, I think it's that kid who
is troubling your daughter too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
She is the one, sir.
When I addressed her as Nithya

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
We will decide later
about going into the house.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.208
he started blabbering
and hitting us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.458
People nearby believe, there are
ghosts in that house.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Both of them grew up
in an orphanage in Madurai.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.625
After that, there has
been no contact from her side.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.791
Hey! There are people
who even kill infants. And you..

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Listen.
First, get out of that room.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.791
Around 10.30? At that time,
there was a sudden breeze.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.208
Anything else, ma'am?
Thanks!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Her evil spirit is furious

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.458
Whatever happened until now
and whatever is happening

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
I can go. But I don't go
anywhere after 8 p.m.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.541
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Hello!
- Hey! How are you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.625
Hey! Don't joke.
- Listen.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.625
If not for ourselves,
at least, for our baby, Mike!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
If I get caught?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
Smita bungalow.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.166
Say something and handle them.
First, let's leave from here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.291
I will come by bus or by train.
Are you safe? Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
I need to go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
"You are searching
for something."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.166
"Only love can quench
the thirst."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.541
Do not worry. Nothing would
have happened to Anu.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
Take care. I love you. Bye!
- Me too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.708
"The heart is thinking."

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.541
"Will it help?"

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:12.041
Okay.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.708
The place we are standing
right now is the one

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:18.125
where a big fire accident
had taken place in 1997

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:19.958
killing 17 people.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.791
That is, in front of
J.K.L. Polytechnic college.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.166
14 years since that incident
took place

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.666
the college has remained closed.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.375
No one passes by this college.

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:29.833
After that fire accident,
the residents in the nearby area

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
say that there are ghosts
roaming around this college.

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.666
One minute.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.833
He's the only person who has
got the guts to talk about it.

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:46.208
Yes, Mr. Perumal.
Don't you believe in ghosts?

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:51.000
I do. I have seen it 4-5 times
but I'm not scared.

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.625
I was an attender
in this very college.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:56.666
So, this college, which
the whole town is scared of

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:58.000
is where
we are going to stay tonight.

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:00.958
We are going to stay back and
find out if it's really haunted

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:06.166
the way people call it to be.

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:11.083
Careful.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.625
Come, let us go upstairs.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.666
What is this?
- What is this?

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.375
This is the library.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.791
Thousands of books
got burnt down.

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.083
These are the remnants.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.375
This is where the students got
burnt down on that fateful day.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:49.750
What is this?
- This is EM Spiter.

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:50.958
What is that?

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.625
In short, if there's a ghost
this pointer will start moving.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.166
Is it so?
- Yes.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.041
When this pointer moves,
if we take

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:03.333
a photo or a video, we'll know
for sure if there is a ghost.

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.625
That is why, I'm roaming
around with this in my hand.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.333
Buddy, is the pointer moving?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.500
No.
Ask them to come over.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:15.333
Then it'll move.
Come on boys. Smart boys.

00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:17.666
If you are scared,
get four more people with you.

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:21.250
Buddy, don't fool around.
You'll do something and go away.

00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:25.250
Sir, be quiet. You've
only been giving a build up

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:26.250
since the time we've come here.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:28.666
No one is to be seen here.
Is second Saturday an holiday?

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:32.541
Buddy, don't fool around.
I'm leaving. Come, let us leave.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.541
Whom are you calling a coward?
- It is you.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.333
From the time we've come
you are not allowing us to work.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.000
The pointer is moving.
It felt like a breeze.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.291
We know that someone is here.

00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:58.500
We have been waiting for you
since a long time.

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:02.041
All of us have come to see you.

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.583
What is this? He's talking
as if it's his neighbor.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.250
Be quiet. You have seen
only four or five of them.

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.208
Shut up and be quiet.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.291
Can we stay here?

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.583
Or should we leave?
Let us know if we must leave.

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.791
Give us some signal or come
and stand in front of us.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:24.708
Otherwise, we'll...

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.208
- Hey! Did you hear that sound?
- Yes.

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:40.250
Perhaps, the sound was caused
by these fallen sticks.

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:41.750
It is not that.

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.416
There was some other sound.

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.916
Such sounds can't be taken
as a signal.

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:54.958
Else, we're going to stay here.
- Hey!

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.750
Where?
- To the right of Muthu.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.208
It went to the left.
In this corner.

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:13.333
Rewind.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:18.250
Oh, no!

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.208
It has gone through that door.

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:22.291
Let us leave, buddy.

00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.875
Buddy, listen to me.
- Keep quiet. - Leave it, buddy.

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:40.708
Hey, look here.

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.291
All of you be alert.
I'll kick open now.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.958
Hey, give it.
Get lost!

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:06.916
Loose!
It got over.

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.875
Hey! Hey!
What is it now?

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:13.125
Could a frightening ghost
have been there in that room?

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:16.750
Right? I see that daily.
I am bored.

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:18.583
Hey!
- Get lost!

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:20.208
Go.

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.125
It is a bit too much.

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.458
You changed it
right at the last moment.

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:32.083
Will it come out of the TV
and catch hold of you? Coward!

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:36.375
Hey, is this a house?

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:39.125
It is as if you are studying to
be a professional ghost hunter.

00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:42.541
Ghost books, DVDs and programs
are lying all over the place.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.166
At times, I doubt
if I'm in love with a ghost.

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.333
I've told you 100 times, I'm not
doing all this for time pass.

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:54.500
I'm doing this research
for my novel.

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:57.416
You keep saying this.
You are writing a lousy novel.

00:05:57.583 --> 00:05:58.791
For that,
do you need such a build up?

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.416
Hey, one day my novel
will get published

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:04.250
and grab all the awards
available. Wait and watch.

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:10.166
Seriously..

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:11.750
Whatever you saw on TV just now,
is it true?

00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:14.000
Are you saying it is not true?
- Are you saying it is true?

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.958
Will any ghost come
and walk in front of your eyes?

00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:21.250
It may walk. It'll walk.
I have seen it myself.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.208
Where?

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:30.083
In my first year of college,
I had a hostel mate named Deepa.

00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:33.500
That day, we were gossiping
until 4 a.m.

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:36.958
Then she went to her room.
I went to my room and slept off.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:41.125
By the time I woke up,
she was dead.

00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:44.125
Suicide.

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:48.500
Have you seen a person
hanging from a noose? - No.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.583
The tongue would be hanging out
this long.

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.500
After that, I couldn't sleep
for nights together.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.583
Suddenly,
her voice could be heard.

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.833
As though she is near me.
As though she is touching me.

00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:03.416
I used to feel as if someone's
always there in my room.

00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:08.208
One night, when I woke up,
I saw her on my bed..

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:11.333
Near my leg.
It was but her.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.583
She was sitting
and staring at me.

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.500
She was talking something to me.

00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:18.041
Suddenly, when I switched on
the light, no one could be seen.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.291
You are not scared. Are you?
- No.. No.. Continue..

00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:25.583
For few days, she was the topic
of discussion in college.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.458
After that, I could not stay
in that hostel at all.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.375
I kept changing rooms

00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:32.250
and now, I'm in this house
after two years.

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:33.625
There is no problem here.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.416
Did you see her after that?
- Yes.

00:07:42.583 --> 00:07:45.083
Of course, I have seen her.
But now, I'm used to it.

00:07:45.708 --> 00:07:48.208
The fear vanished and instead,
an interest developed.

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:52.833
I even tried talking to her
once. But she didn't respond.

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:56.958
Why? Even now,
she could be in this room.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.958
She could be sitting beside us,
listening to our conversation.

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:27.875
Actually, if something like this
happens to someone close to us

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:29.375
such thoughts
are bound to occur.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.250
Based on those thoughts,
you're imagining overly..

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:32.500
These are not just thoughts.
They do exist.

00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:35.750
100 to 200 people commit suicide
in a year, in Chennai alone.

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:38.208
Do you know that?
So many die in accidents.

00:08:46.083 --> 00:08:46.958
No.

00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:50.625
Two years back,
the death of two policemen

00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:53.166
at the same bungalow's entrance,
still remains to be a mystery.

00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:57.083
Which area is the bungalow
located in? - Why?

00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.583
Is it to feel scared every time
you happen to visit that area?

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:02.625
Haven't you said enough now
for me to feel scared?

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:25.291
Honestly, do these ghosts
and spirits really exist?

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.541
Everyone faces a moment
like this in life.

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:30.291
A moment that will make
the unbelievable, believable.

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:33.250
If something like that happened
to you, you'll also believe.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.625
Baby..
Your moment is waiting.

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:53.208
"This is about a person,
not a dream."

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:55.041
"Like a riddle,
this is not what it seems."

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:56.958
"I know this start is puzzling".

00:09:57.166 --> 00:09:58.958
"Gotta make it fit
like the rhythm of need."

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.125
"to move both hands and feet.
Darn!"

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.625
What if he suddenly bites me?
- You are too much!

00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:58.708
Who are you? Why are you
standing here? Get lost!

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.250
Hey! - Hey!
Can't you hear us?

00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:01.750
Hey! - Go away.
- Hey.. Hey..

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:03.291
Leave him.
- Sir.

00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:06.875
Had you called me up, I'd have
come to the bus stand itself.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.625
Come, sir.
Come inside. Come.

00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:12.625
Instead of ushering him inside,
you were..

00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:13.916
I'll deal
with both of you later.

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:26.333
It is Ramalingam sir,
who had given me your number.

00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:30.708
Is your family
looking for a bride for you?

00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:31.833
Why do you ask?

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:36.083
I asked as your uncle is meeting

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.208
all kinds of weird people.

00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:39.250
Does he look
like a marriage broker to you?

00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.583
Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:44.166
It'll be better
if you see for yourself.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.375
Not a broker but he could have
a beautiful daughter, right?

00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:51.791
You think he can have a daughter
like actress Nayantara?

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:54.375
Looks like uncle has called him
to do black magic.

00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:56.791
Sir.

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:04.041
Tell me. Okay. Ask him if he
wants to have something. - Okay.

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.333
Would you like to have
tea or coffee?

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:14.833
Will you have tea or coffee?

00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:19.208
I have not had lunch yet.
I'll have lunch.

00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:23.500
What will you have?
Will you have meals or 'parota'?

00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:27.333
One medium Margherita pizza
with double cheese

00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:38.541
with double cheese
and pepperoni topping.

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.291
He is talking excellent English.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.375
Sir!
- What?

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:44.916
Who is he?

00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:47.583
Looks like my head
will burst out of curiosity.

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:51.583
Dear, there are few matters
which if you don't know

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.416
will only make you feel
that your head will burst.

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:56.666
But if you got to know,
it will burst for sure.

00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:15.666
Anu!

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:18.291
Hey, Anu!

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:27.208
It's drenched.
Now, what should I wear?

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:34.958
not to forget
to bring it inside.

00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:49.125
Can't you do anything properly?

00:13:51.916 --> 00:13:52.875
Look here.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:55.791
What should I wear to work now?

00:13:57.375 --> 00:13:59.208
Hey, why are you crying now?

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.041
Why have you come and sat here?

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:16.250
Why are you crying?

00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:35.125
Anu, in some matters,
you are very careless.

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:36.958
That is why, I scolded you.

00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:42.083
I scolded you for your good.

00:14:52.916 --> 00:14:56.041
Tell me. Have you
ever seen me being careless?

00:14:58.166 --> 00:14:59.416
I'm pregnant.

00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.291
Both of us are careless
at few things.

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:22.958
Did you go to the doctor?

00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:25.083
I will be going
to the doctor today.

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:29.083
What shall we do
if the doctor confirms it?

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:31.041
What do you mean by that?

00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:33.958
No..

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.875
Shall we abort it? Are you
asking me to commit a murder?

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:47.958
No, Anu!
Both of us aren't married yet.

00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:59.958
We are managing in this outhouse
by bribing the watchman.

00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:03.208
Who is there to support us?

00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:06.250
You get emotional
by calling it a murder.

00:16:07.458 --> 00:16:10.625
It happened accidentally.
Let's think practically.

00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:12.125
Shut up.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.500
You're talking
as if we met only yesterday

00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:32.291
But not now.
After two years..

00:16:32.916 --> 00:16:35.416
We will be settled at that time.
- So, for two years

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:30.458
Dude!

00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:34.583
Dude!
Take it and go.

00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.250
Do you have change for Rs.500?

00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:02.333
Excuse me.
Do you have change for Rs.500?

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:04.416
Hello?

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.958
I asked if you have change
for Rs.500?

00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:08.500
I don't have change!

00:18:13.541 --> 00:18:15.291
Have this.
Come on.

00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:17.833
I don't want it.
- Have this.

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.375
No.
- Excuse me.

00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:27.750
Eat.

00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:31.916
Eat.
- You feed her.

00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:41.500
Thank you.
- Good girl.

00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:42.708
Sweet girl.

00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:23.750
Stop it. Always,
laughing like a mad fellow.

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.916
Why is he looking
so serious now?

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:27.958
If this had been my hometown

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.125
they would have
beat him black and blue.

00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:31.083
They themselves would
have bought him new clothes

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.750
and would have conducted
the wedding also.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.958
He is ready
to live in with his girlfriend

00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:37.583
but hesitant
when it comes to commitment.

00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:40.958
What is this? You are talking
as if I've committed a rape.

00:19:41.416 --> 00:19:43.750
Boss! We have been in love
since our school days.

00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:46.291
No matter when, but only she
will be my wife.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.833
Sir, how to manage marriage
and children with this salary?

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.375
All this is god's gift, dude!

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:07.125
Hello, Boss! What?
- Keep quiet!

00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:11.041
What's up with him?
- All that is a sin.

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:13.375
You should not
get abortion done. Not at all!

00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:14.708
What do you say?

00:20:14.875 --> 00:20:16.083
Is that so?
- Sir..

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.708
Shall we file
a case on the company?

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:39.250
Michael! You say you will
marry only her whenever it be.

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:45.041
Mostly, people who come asking
for divorce come in costly cars.

00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.250
So, rather than fretting
yourself over money

00:20:48.416 --> 00:20:52.000
get married.
Am I right?

00:21:04.041 --> 00:21:05.125
You are going
to become a father.

00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.083
Sorry. Sorry. You are going
to become a father.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.750
Then, you are going to marry.
Give us treat.

00:21:13.833 --> 00:21:15.125
Anu!

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.416
Anu!

00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:54.583
Anu!

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.083
'This is the last time
I will be washing'

00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:28.791
Anyway, I am not your wife
to wash your clothes.

00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:31.250
You are unfit to marry me.

00:22:31.666 --> 00:22:39.666
Dumb fellow! Foolish monkey!
You idiot! Fool! Stupid dog..

00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:32.666
Seriously.

00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:40.875
Here?
Without anyone's presence?

00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:43.000
Whom do you want?

00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:47.375
Grand Dinner.
Party with all our friends.

00:23:48.791 --> 00:23:50.833
Lavish wedding can be done
once we are able to afford it.

00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:52.291
Now, we will do it for our sake.

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.958
Are you serious?
- Yes.

00:23:57.708 --> 00:23:59.041
What about fixing
an auspicious date?

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:04.291
I wish to marry on 12-12-12.
It is also Superstar's birthday.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.125
Happy birthday, Superstar!

00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:22.375
Something that I'd saved money
and bought for our marriage.

00:24:35.583 --> 00:24:37.000
How is it?
- No.

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:39.750
Okay?
- Nice.

00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:51.250
One minute.

00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:59.416
I am Michael.
You are Anu.

00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:05.625
In life and death, in highs and
lows, in happiness and sorrow

00:25:05.791 --> 00:25:11.416
accept me as your better half.
Whole.. Heartedly..

00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:16.541
Hey!
Will you marry me?

00:25:32.791 --> 00:25:41.916
"It becomes sweeter
like the shadow of flower".

00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:46.791
"Desire shield;
Third day of the no moon day".

00:25:47.083 --> 00:25:51.666
"Even the bamboo tree
will give you a kiss".

00:25:51.916 --> 00:25:56.458
"Desire shield;
Third day of the no moon day".

00:25:56.708 --> 00:26:01.625
"Even the bamboo tree
will give you a kiss".

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.500
I love you, Anu!
- I love you too, Michael!

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.500
Hey, wife!
- Tell me.

00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:30.916
Hey, wife!
- Tell me.

00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:37.708
Are you happy?
- Are we really married?

00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:46.416
From tomorrow onwards,
wash my clothes and iron it.

00:27:18.958 --> 00:27:23.291
"My fingers will touch
your eyes like a fresh air".

00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:28.833
"In the flower bed,
you talk about the silence".

00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:37.708
"Love... In loneliness,
you gave me love".

00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:45.708
"You hugged me even
in the interval. Love..."

00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:56.583
"Your hair strands
and dripping rain".

00:27:57.041 --> 00:28:03.333
"With your love,
I dream a lot in my mind".

00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:15.208
"Your life and its music..."

00:28:15.958 --> 00:28:25.125
"It becomes sweeter
like the shadow of flower".

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:30.083
"Desire shield;
Third day of the no moon day".

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:35.000
"Even the bamboo tree
will give you a kiss".

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.708
"Desire shield;
Third day of the no moon day".

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:49.333
"She is the cloud
and she is the rain drop".

00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:53.375
"She is my eyes"

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.916
"she is the breeze
and she is the sweet smell".

00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:03.500
"She is the word
and she is the meaning".

00:29:37.833 --> 00:29:39.458
Hey! I am done
listening to all that you said.

00:29:39.625 --> 00:29:40.583
Now,
listen to what I have to say.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.166
I must get that parcel.
Hey!

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.375
One minute.
Hey! Michael!

00:29:58.291 --> 00:29:59.750
Tell me, uncle!
- Come inside.

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:01.833
I'm looking at the accounts.

00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:03.583
Shall I send Michael in?
- Okay, send him in.

00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:06.333
Mike?

00:30:08.958 --> 00:30:11.583
Don't irritate me by saying
the same thing again and again.

00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:17.583
Look. I want to deal
with the matter decently.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.166
If you wish to deal
in some other way

00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:20.750
I am quite ready to stoop
to those levels as well.

00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:23.166
Don't delay further.
Send the parcel at the earliest.

00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:25.791
Okay.
Cut the call.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.083
How is the business going?
- It's weekend, right?

00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:32.958
Hence, there are
lot of deliveries.

00:30:33.375 --> 00:30:35.666
Raghavan said that you got
married. - Yes, sir.

00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:37.541
You didn't invite us.
- Actually, sir..

00:30:39.625 --> 00:30:41.625
We are planning to invite
everyone for Christmas

00:30:45.541 --> 00:30:46.625
Yes, sir!

00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:51.500
That's best. Better than
inviting everyone and spending

00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:54.125
and fighting over the taste
of the dishes offered.

00:30:54.416 --> 00:30:57.791
Okay, here. Go home
and give this file to Laskshmi.

00:30:58.625 --> 00:31:00.708
Tell her that the auditor
will be there in an hour.

00:31:00.916 --> 00:31:03.291
Ask her to give it to him.
- Okay, sir!

00:31:28.166 --> 00:31:30.666
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. I am trying.

00:31:30.958 --> 00:31:32.791
Ma'am!
- Priya ma'am!

00:31:33.083 --> 00:31:35.625
What is happening there?
- Come back. Come back.

00:31:35.791 --> 00:31:38.958
There is nothing over there.
Hold her hands.

00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:41.125
It's nothing.
- Come.

00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:44.208
Take her inside. - Come inside.
- Okay. It's okay.

00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:19.416
After my last visit,
did something like this happen?

00:32:19.583 --> 00:32:22.958
No, sir!
- No. It has happened twice.

00:32:23.208 --> 00:32:26.125
But not to this extent.
That's why..

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.916
What is this, sir?
- I wasn't aware myself.

00:32:31.583 --> 00:32:32.791
What are you saying?
- No..

00:32:32.958 --> 00:32:34.125
It had happened
when you were out of town..

00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:36.041
Both of you aren't deceiving me.

00:32:37.208 --> 00:32:39.541
It's your daughter whom
you're killing little by little.

00:32:41.791 --> 00:32:44.458
Sorry, sir!
- Come on.

00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:47.583
You have to talk.

00:32:47.833 --> 00:32:49.458
Only then,
I will be able to understand.

00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:51.250
Why do you come?

00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:56.541
Why do you put this small girl
through suffering? Very bad.

00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:03.166
Priya! Priya! Priya!

00:33:04.291 --> 00:33:05.875
Nithya!

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.250
This is the only thing
you say every time.

00:33:24.833 --> 00:33:26.375
Do you wish to avenge someone?

00:33:47.833 --> 00:33:50.166
Is there a show going on here?
First, ask him to leave.

00:33:50.416 --> 00:33:51.583
Michael!

00:33:53.083 --> 00:33:54.791
Nithya!

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:58.083
What should be done so that
you don't trouble her anymore?

00:33:58.291 --> 00:34:00.125
Tell me! - You go to the shop.
- Okay, sir.

00:34:00.791 --> 00:34:01.666
Nithya!

00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:03.625
Michael!
- Sir.

00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:06.833
What do you want? When will you
stop troubling her?

00:34:31.208 --> 00:34:32.666
Didn't I tell you the other day?

00:34:33.541 --> 00:34:34.916
Your moment has finally arrived?

00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:52.875
'You can guess the presence
of ghosts with certain signals.'

00:34:53.041 --> 00:34:53.958
'How?'

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:56.041
'Somewhere in the distance,
a dog will howl.'

00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:08.750
"Generations will realize it
very well".

00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:40.000
Ever since, she has been
suffering like this.

00:35:51.791 --> 00:35:58.041
"There is a dream inside
dream which disturbs a lot".

00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:11.541
There will be stones, right?
I kept watching.

00:36:37.666 --> 00:36:40.041
Yeah. Sure. Your order
will be there in 45 minutes.

00:36:43.541 --> 00:36:46.750
Michael!
Home delivery. Be quick.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.250
Sir!
- Yes.

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:50.250
One medium chicken delight.
One chocolate Fantasy.

00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:51.958
Delivery.
- Okay, sir!

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.416
Sir.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.166
Give this in my house.

00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:19.333
Sir, I'm on a delivery errand.
If you want, Pandy can..

00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:21.000
Finish the errand
and then go.

00:37:39.083 --> 00:37:41.458
Oh! I didn't mean it
in that way. You.. - Get lost.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.458
Nithya.

00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:05.875
Hey!

00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:10.416
Hey..
Raghava! What happened?

00:38:15.791 --> 00:38:17.541
Why is there blood
all over your body?

00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:18.958
Where did you go and what..
- Michael.

00:38:19.125 --> 00:38:20.291
Michael?
Where is he?

00:38:20.458 --> 00:38:24.541
What happened to him?
Tell me what the matter is.

00:38:39.208 --> 00:38:41.708
Michael.
- Sir!

00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:46.666
Sir!
- What happened?

00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:48.958
Anu, sir!

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.458
My Anu, sir!

00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:52.583
What happened to Anu?

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.291
He has been repeating
the same word like a mad man.

00:38:58.458 --> 00:39:01.083
Leave him.
Get him a chair.

00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:10.583
Stop crying.

00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:16.291
Stop crying!
Tell me. What happened?

00:39:26.875 --> 00:39:28.666
It was for a bungalow
in Anna Nagar.

00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:48.041
Good evening, Ma'am!
- Good evening!

00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:49.208
Pizzas.

00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:51.125
This is what you call
delivery in 45 minutes, is it?

00:39:51.291 --> 00:39:52.125
Sorry, Ma'am!

00:39:52.291 --> 00:39:55.750
Got little delayed
on my way here. - Little late?

00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:56.833
'Now, you are going
to hear a duet song.'

00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:59.458
Sorry.
But the pizza's really hot.

00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:00.833
Okay, fine. Come in.
'- The song is from the movie..'

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.333
'...Vetri Vizha'.

00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:08.125
"The fresh air uttered
my name and I heard it now".

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.458
Please keep that here.
- Sorry, Ma'am!

00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:14.125
I asked you to keep it here.
- Oh!

00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:16.750
It's okay.
No problem.

00:40:17.125 --> 00:40:21.750
What is the bill amount?
- It is Rs.435, Ma'am.

00:40:21.958 --> 00:40:23.666
Okay.
One minute.

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:56.166
'The fresh air uttered my
name and I heard it now.'

00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:58.416
Oh! I don't have change
for Rs.1000, Ma'am.

00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:01.333
Shouldn't you have
brought change with you?

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.666
No. Actually,
I have change for Rs. 500.

00:41:03.833 --> 00:41:04.833
I didn't bring for Rs.1000.

00:41:04.958 --> 00:41:06.125
Sorry, ma'am.

00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:08.333
Ever since you've come, you've
been saying 'sorry' a lot.

00:41:09.041 --> 00:41:11.708
Sorry, Ma'am.
- Okay. Is it Rs.435?

00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:17.375
"Cheating..
Cheating.."

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.708
"Cheating..
Cheating.."

00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:36.291
"Cheating..
Cheating.. Heart is too rough."

00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:41.250
"Cheating..
Cheating.. Heart is too rough."

00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:46.750
"Thousands of dramas
and thousands of roles."

00:42:08.958 --> 00:42:13.250
Ma'am! - Yes. - Shall I go to
the restaurant and get change?

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.958
It is alright,
I will check upstairs.

00:42:52.208 --> 00:42:55.750
By the time I get you the change
the pizza will turn cold.

00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:57.958
Give it to me.
I will put it in the hot bag.

00:42:58.333 --> 00:43:00.083
Yes.
Sure.

00:43:30.583 --> 00:43:31.958
Ma'am!

00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:47.833
Ma'am!

00:43:55.875 --> 00:43:57.541
Where are you?

00:43:58.041 --> 00:43:59.041
Ma'am!

00:44:11.458 --> 00:44:12.583
Ma'am!

00:44:20.166 --> 00:44:21.541
What happened?

00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:23.750
Hello!

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:33.416
Ma'am!

00:45:02.958 --> 00:45:05.041
Ma'am, where are you?

00:45:36.958 --> 00:45:38.583
Ma'am!

00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:12.791
Ma'am..

00:46:59.125 --> 00:47:00.458
Ma'am..

00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:40.458
Help!

00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:18.166
Oh, no!

00:49:33.916 --> 00:49:38.041
'You do not have sufficient
balance to call this number.'

00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:41.375
'Please try again
after recharging your number.'

00:50:07.583 --> 00:50:10.583
Call me, Anu!
Please! Call me.

00:50:31.708 --> 00:50:33.458
"It's shocking."

00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:51.333
"It's shocking."

00:51:06.666 --> 00:51:12.375
"It's shocking; this heart
desires to unite with you."

00:51:12.708 --> 00:51:15.208
"It's shocking."

00:51:23.708 --> 00:51:31.500
"It's shocking; this heart
desires to unite with you."

00:51:35.416 --> 00:51:37.583
"It's shocking."

00:51:41.208 --> 00:51:49.125
"It's shocking; this heart
desires to unite with you."

00:51:53.125 --> 00:51:55.333
"It's shocking."

00:51:58.916 --> 00:52:02.166
"It's shocking."

00:53:22.791 --> 00:53:24.250
Who is that?

00:53:47.083 --> 00:53:49.625
Sir!
Sir, help, sir!

00:53:55.375 --> 00:53:56.708
Sir!
Look over here, sir!

00:53:57.083 --> 00:53:59.833
Sir!
Help, Sir!

00:54:06.708 --> 00:54:08.958
Sir!
Save me, sir!

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:10.166
Sir!

00:54:12.833 --> 00:54:15.458
"It's shocking."

00:54:18.666 --> 00:54:20.458
"It's shocking."

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.750
"It's shocking."

00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:36.333
Hello!
Hello, sir!

00:54:56.083 --> 00:54:58.208
Smita!
Smita!

00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.083
Smita!

00:55:02.625 --> 00:55:05.958
- Sir! Sir! It's locked
from inside. - Smita!

00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:10.750
Sir!
Can you hear me, sir?

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.333
"It's shocking."

00:55:26.916 --> 00:55:29.875
Hello, Sir! Sir!
Can you hear me, sir?

00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.208
Hey! Who are you?

00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:33.708
Where is Smita?
- Sir, please!

00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:35.083
Why are you
picking up her phone?

00:55:39.583 --> 00:55:40.916
Sir, I came here
to deliver pizza.

00:55:41.083 --> 00:55:42.208
Someone has..

00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:44.166
What?
Did you come to deliver pizza?

00:55:44.333 --> 00:55:45.458
Yes, sir!

00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:47.375
What are you bluffing?

00:55:47.541 --> 00:55:49.541
Both of you thought,
I'm out of station, is it?

00:55:49.708 --> 00:55:50.708
No, sir!

00:55:50.875 --> 00:55:52.625
Where is she?
Open the door. Smita!

00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:56.250
Sir, it is locked from inside.
How do I unlock it?

00:55:56.708 --> 00:55:58.833
Ask her to insert the key
and open the door.

00:56:00.291 --> 00:56:02.041
Listen to me..
- Where is she? Smita! - Sir!

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:06.458
Sir, someone has killed ma'am.
- Really?

00:56:08.666 --> 00:56:11.333
Are you making up stories
after getting caught red-handed?

00:56:12.291 --> 00:56:13.666
Should i break the
door and come inside?

00:56:13.833 --> 00:56:16.208
No, sir!
- I will kill both of you.

00:56:16.625 --> 00:56:17.916
I won't even think
that she is my wife.

00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:21.416
Please listen to me, sir!
- First, open the door.

00:56:21.791 --> 00:56:23.875
I came to deliver pizza, sir.
Ma'am came and got it. - Open..

00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:26.083
You call her first.
- Sir, please listen to me.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.583
Are you going
to open the door or not?

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:30.000
Hey, fool!
Listen to what I'm saying.

00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:34.291
Oh, no!
Sorry, sir..

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.875
Please listen to what
I'm saying. Please, sir! Please.

00:56:38.583 --> 00:56:39.458
What is it?

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:01.791
Murdered her?
- Yes, sir.

00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:04.625
When I went upstairs again
after some time

00:57:04.791 --> 00:57:07.875
here dead body was missing.
Sir! Sir!

00:57:08.041 --> 00:57:11.125
Someone is here inside.
All the doors are locked.

00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:14.250
Please save me, sir!
I am innocent. Please! Please!

00:57:14.416 --> 00:57:17.416
Okay. First, you open the door.
- All the doors are locked.

00:57:17.583 --> 00:57:21.583
How can I, sir?
Sir! Sir! Please, sir!

00:57:25.916 --> 00:57:28.625
Check if there is a key in it.
Go fast.

00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:39.041
There is an easy chair
in the living room.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.500
Can you see two statues?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:45.708
There will be a small bowl.
Check if the key is in it?

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:54.458
You go upstairs.
Have you gone?

00:57:54.958 --> 00:57:56.791
I'm going, sir.
- Have you reached?

00:57:59.666 --> 00:58:01.208
Beyond that, there will be a
corridor on the left. Go there.

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:07.916
Did you go?
- I reached, sir.

00:58:08.166 --> 00:58:09.833
Go to the second room
on the right.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.291
Sir? - The second room
on the right. Did you go?

00:58:15.541 --> 00:58:18.208
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Can you
spot a dressing table there?

00:58:18.791 --> 00:58:19.833
Yes. It's there.

00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:25.291
Open the first draw.
What did you find?

00:58:25.875 --> 00:58:27.000
Gun, sir.

00:58:27.291 --> 00:58:29.958
What is it?
- It's a gun, sir!

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.000
Is the key there?
- There are many keys, sir!

00:58:37.208 --> 00:58:38.416
Among those, the one
with the black key chain..

00:58:38.583 --> 00:58:40.500
Grab it and come down quickly.
- Okay, sir.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:59:01.208
Sir! It's not opening, sir!
Is it locked from outside? Sir!

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:45.583
Who is it?

01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:48.875
Who is it?

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.875
Where are you?

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.333
I will kill you if I find you!

01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:48.500
"Sixteen ragas and their origin;
when I sing."

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.875
Hello!
- Hello!

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:06.833
Who is it?
- Hey! Are you asking who I'm?

01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:09.291
Anu!
Is it Anu?

01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:11.750
I am Anu speaking.

01:06:12.416 --> 01:06:17.333
Hey! How did you
get this number?

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.875
What are you blabbering?
I've called your mobile number.

01:06:21.958 --> 01:06:26.416
Did you call on my mobile?
Are you talking to that number?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.416
I am talking from an old,
disconnected phone.

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:48.541
Mike! Don't joke.
It's not at all funny.

01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:51.333
Please believe, Anu!
I am trapped in a house.

01:06:51.916 --> 01:06:52.958
I don't understand
what's going on.

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:55.041
Two people are dead.
Their dead bodies are missing.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.583
I don't know what to do.
- Mike! Just relax.

01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:59.916
Relax and be calm.
Tell me. What happened?

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.083
Actually, I came
to deliver a pizza.

01:07:19.916 --> 01:07:21.208
I don't understand what to do.
Please, Anu!

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:23.250
Michael, something
is seriously wrong.

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.833
Anu! Anu! Please, Anu! Inform
the police. Please save me.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.208
Okay. Okay.
Is it on Lake road?

01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:33.125
Yes. 23, Lake town.
There is my bike outside.

01:07:33.958 --> 01:07:36.000
Please, Anu! Inform the police.
- Don't get scared. Be brave.

01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:38.083
I will call the police at once.
- Please!

01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.291
Anu!

01:08:53.083 --> 01:08:55.083
Hello! Police station?
- Anu?

01:08:55.583 --> 01:08:57.208
Michael!
Are you in the police station?

01:08:57.375 --> 01:08:58.750
No, Anu!

01:08:58.916 --> 01:09:02.958
You've dialed the same number.
- What? No way. Michael!

01:09:03.208 --> 01:09:04.958
I dialed
the police station number.

01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:07.750
Something is happening there.

01:09:08.833 --> 01:09:11.250
All my calls are routed
to that number.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.125
Anu! The lady I told you
was dead..

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:21.041
Her towel, money. Everything
is scattered here. I am scared.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.250
Take deep breath.
Take deep breath. Don't panic.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:33.458
Michael! I will bring
the police right away.

01:09:33.708 --> 01:09:36.583
Be strong.
Okay? Don't give up.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.083
I will be there
in the next twenty minutes.

01:09:39.333 --> 01:09:42.375
Don't be scared.
Michael! Be strong.

01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:46.666
Come fast. Please!
- Michael, I will come soon.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:25.583
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:31.333
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:52.541
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:57.125
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:10:57.833 --> 01:11:02.750
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:07.958
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:12.958
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:16.500
"O, dear! Come on, dear.."

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.791
'NITHYA, V - D'

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:36.375
'Nithya!'

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:04.708
Anu!
- Hello! Hey, Michael!

01:13:06.041 --> 01:13:09.083
I am Shanmugam speaking.
- Sir..

01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:10.750
What?

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:12.583
The customer called up to say,
the delivery hasn't reached.

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:14.083
My wife told that
you didn't go home. - No, sir.

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:17.250
I got trapped in the place
where I'd come to deliver pizza.

01:13:17.416 --> 01:13:21.333
What? Delivery? - Sir. - Hello!
I am not able to hear anything.

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:25.958
Hello!
- Hello!

01:13:26.166 --> 01:13:27.833
Can you hear me?
- Hello!

01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:30.166
What is this?
He is talking in a shaky tone.

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:31.916
Go and see if he has fallen
from the bike.

01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:35.625
No, sir! Sir! Sir!
Can you hear me, sir? Sir!

01:13:37.541 --> 01:13:38.791
Sir!

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:55.041
Nithya..

01:16:12.666 --> 01:16:16.208
What happened?
- Over there.

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:15.041
Turn on the main switch.
There is someone inside.

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.125
Inside..

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:37.750
Sir, there is are ghosts inside.

01:17:41.916 --> 01:17:43.541
Sit down.

01:17:43.708 --> 01:17:45.416
Sit down.
Sit down. - Sir.

01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:57.041
Sir, let's go. Please, sir!
- Hello, sir.

01:17:57.833 --> 01:17:59.958
Sir, we were going for rounds
near Smita's bungalow.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:01.833
We felt there was
someone inside.

01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:07.708
We found an intruder inside.
No, sir. He looks like..

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:09.708
He is wearing
a hotel uniform, sir.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.500
He is talking
like a mental case, sir.

01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:14.583
No, sir.
All that is not there, sir.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.041
If you send the jeep immediately

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:17.458
we'll bring him
to the station at once.

01:18:20.791 --> 01:18:23.083
Sir, first let us go away
from here. Let's go, sir.

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:25.541
Hey, check whether
he has got any weapons.

01:18:31.458 --> 01:18:33.208
Sir, why are you checking me?

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.083
You came here
only after I informed you.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.375
Sir, I didn't
inform you directly.

01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:43.166
But Anu must have
informed you, sir.

01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:46.958
Hey, don't keep talking.
Sit down. Sit!

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:50.166
Sir, there is nothing.
He is clear.

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:56.000
Anu! Anu would have only
informed the police station.

01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:58.458
No one by that name came.

01:19:02.375 --> 01:19:04.875
Sir, please give me your phone.
Let me make a call.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.416
Sir, just tell me this.

01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:18.333
Without Anu intimating you,
how did you come here?

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.208
Do you want us to tell you
how we came?

01:19:20.416 --> 01:19:22.791
How did you enter the house
which is sealed by the police?

01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:26.500
What? Is this house
sealed by the police?

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.125
Sir, there were people
in this house. - Hey!

01:19:34.541 --> 01:19:36.666
Sir, I'm not a mental case.
I won't run away anywhere.

01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:38.291
Sir, please.
Listen to what I have to say.

01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:39.666
Tell me.

01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:41.541
I came to deliver pizza.

01:19:42.833 --> 01:19:44.333
One lady came
and took the delivery.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.000
Asking me to keep it inside,
she went upstairs to get cash.

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.416
After some time,
I heard a noise.

01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:02.041
Where?
- Upstairs.

01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:04.958
Check the house thoroughly once.
- Okay, sir.

01:21:12.458 --> 01:21:15.666
Sir, what had happened
in this house?

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:21.916
Tell me, sir.
Please, sir!

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.708
Don't you know about it?

01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:33.666
Investigation is going on.
All the evidences are inside.

01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:36.041
How did you enter this place?
- Sir, I'm telling the truth.

01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:37.916
I came here to deliver pizza.

01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:41.041
I saw all those three people
whose outlines you have marked.

01:21:41.291 --> 01:21:42.458
The souls of those three people
are here, sir.

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:43.958
We need not be here, sir.
Let us go.

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:45.958
Take me to the station.
Please, sir.

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:49.875
Sir!

01:21:50.625 --> 01:21:52.333
Is it three murders
or four murders, sir?

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.166
Four.

01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:58.875
Who is the fourth one, sir?

01:21:59.208 --> 01:22:04.666
A husband, wife, one small girl
and then another girl.

01:22:07.916 --> 01:22:11.625
Sir, I saw
only three bodies inside.

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.708
The fourth one is outside.
In the garden.

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:16.416
Who is that girl, sir?

01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:20.333
It is a girl who had studied
in Christ college.

01:22:22.458 --> 01:22:24.333
Christ college!

01:22:26.583 --> 01:22:28.291
What is her name?

01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:32.000
Her name is something like..

01:22:33.208 --> 01:22:36.000
You kept repeating a girl's name
again and again.

01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:48.750
Why are you getting tensed?

01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:51.125
Weren't you the one who asked
Anu to inform us to come?

01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:53.875
Yes, sir.
Just now, I spoke with Anu.

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:56.250
Then what? It's been
one week since that Anu died.

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:16.666
Tell me the full address.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.416
34, Rohini Illam,
Rassappa street.

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:26.583
Why are you asking me, sir?
Sir, I'm scared.

01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:29.791
Is Anu alright, sir?

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:31.958
How are you related to her?

01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:33.791
I am her husband, sir.
- What?

01:23:34.416 --> 01:23:38.916
Husband. Recently.
Few days back, we got married.

01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:43.000
Why are you asking me?

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:47.833
Why did you ask
for my phone that time?

01:23:54.083 --> 01:23:56.125
I thought you had come
after she informed you.

01:23:57.541 --> 01:23:59.291
Give me the phone, sir.

01:24:17.458 --> 01:24:20.208
'This number is not in use
at present.' - What is it?

01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:28.000
Sir, it seems
the number is not in use.

01:24:31.875 --> 01:24:34.791
Is your name Michael?
Michael Karthikeyan.

01:24:35.583 --> 01:24:37.458
Your native place is Madurai.

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:40.250
How do you know all this, sir?

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:43.375
Sit down.
Sit down!

01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:48.625
If you try to call a girl
who had died one week before

01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:50.208
how will you
get through the line?

01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:53.833
The Anu you're referring was
lying dead

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.250
in this house a week ago.

01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:57.375
Murder. She was pregnant
at that time. - No.. No..

01:24:57.541 --> 01:25:00.333
No chance, sir!

01:25:01.083 --> 01:25:02.791
That can't be my Anu.

01:25:03.083 --> 01:25:06.500
Just now.. Just sometime back
I talked to her.

01:25:07.291 --> 01:25:08.791
Don't blabber, sir.

01:25:09.083 --> 01:25:09.958
For enquiry purpose

01:25:10.125 --> 01:25:11.041
we've been looking for
you since last five days.

01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:12.791
Where had you escaped to?
- No.. Anu!

01:25:12.958 --> 01:25:14.958
Sir, I checked the whole house.

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:18.583
Only one bike is standing.
I think that must be his bike.

01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:20.625
I've my doubts on him, sir.

01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:23.000
Once we take him to the station
and bash him up

01:25:23.166 --> 01:25:24.666
he'll speak the truth, sir.

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:26.500
There's no need for all that.

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:29.583
He's Michael,
whom we were looking for.

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:43.333
She must have asked you
to come here.

01:25:46.666 --> 01:25:49.083
Fool! - Hey!
- Talking like a fool.

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:54.916
Anu!

01:26:58.333 --> 01:26:59.333
Anu!

01:27:07.083 --> 01:27:08.291
Anu!

01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:19.375
Anu!

01:27:25.458 --> 01:27:26.750
Anu..

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.500
He is going on calling us
to ask if we found him.

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:39.541
What should we answer him?
- Hey!

01:27:39.708 --> 01:27:41.250
Michael! Where were you?
- I need to make a call.

01:27:41.416 --> 01:27:43.958
What is it?
- Give me the phone.

01:27:44.166 --> 01:27:45.458
Give me the phone.
- What is it?

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:55.500
Tell us.
What happened?

01:27:55.666 --> 01:27:58.541
'The person you are trying
to call is out of range.'

01:27:58.708 --> 01:28:00.250
What happened?

01:28:00.416 --> 01:28:02.833
It says, the phone's
out of range. Anu is missing.

01:28:02.958 --> 01:28:04.625
Nothing like that.
- They are saying she is dead.

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:09.458
- No, sir.
- First, you take rest.

01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:11.708
I must look for Anu.
- Hey! - Mike! - First come.

01:28:11.916 --> 01:28:14.375
No. I'll talk to sir later.
- Come with us.

01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:17.375
I'll talk to him.
- Listen to us. - Hey!

01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:20.791
Mike! - Mike! Stop!
- Mike, listen to us!

01:28:21.625 --> 01:28:22.750
I said, stop!

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.291
I said I want to go, right?
- Why are you hitting him?

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:28.000
I must go!

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:31.375
I'm going on saying.

01:28:34.083 --> 01:28:35.166
Don't, sir.

01:28:39.208 --> 01:28:42.625
Leave him.
Leave him.

01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:45.666
Listen to me.
Don't hit.

01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:04.208
Didn't I tell you?

01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:18.208
Don't!

01:29:28.541 --> 01:29:33.625
Don't, sir..
Don't, sir.. Don't, sir..

01:29:33.791 --> 01:29:36.291
I must look for Anu.
She is missing.

01:29:36.458 --> 01:29:39.500
Don't, sir..
Don't..

01:29:42.916 --> 01:29:44.916
She had gone to the police
to rescue me.

01:29:51.333 --> 01:29:56.208
I have been looking for her
all over. That's when they came.

01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:04.083
Anu.

01:30:14.875 --> 01:30:20.333
Okay. I will.
Where is your bag?

01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:33.125
Bag..

01:30:45.666 --> 01:30:49.250
My hand, my back..

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.833
They would have killed me there.

01:31:01.625 --> 01:31:03.625
Those three people
have harmed my Anu.

01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:12.625
From the day I saw your daughter
nothing has been going right.

01:31:13.583 --> 01:31:16.666
I lost my happiness.
I lose my peace.

01:31:17.083 --> 01:31:20.125
I lost my sleep.
I even lost Anu.

01:31:26.541 --> 01:31:32.375
Anu is..
Anu is my baby, sir.

01:31:36.916 --> 01:31:39.375
She is my baby.

01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:58.541
Sir, I think it's that kid who
is troubling your daughter too.

01:32:00.041 --> 01:32:05.250
She is the one, sir.
When I addressed her as Nithya

01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:19.833
Hey, Michael!
What happened?

01:32:29.875 --> 01:32:31.833
Slow.
Slow.

01:32:34.083 --> 01:32:36.083
Shall we go to the police?

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.208
Can this matter be told
to the police?

01:32:41.916 --> 01:32:44.041
Where is the bungalow
he is talking about?

01:32:44.958 --> 01:32:47.041
Smita bungalow,
Anna Nagar.

01:32:47.833 --> 01:32:49.875
People say it's a haunted house.

01:32:50.416 --> 01:32:52.166
Shall we barge in
and check the bungalow?

01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:55.208
Don't act in haste.

01:32:56.375 --> 01:32:58.041
You listened to what he said.

01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:00.583
I wonder if Nithya,
who is troubling my daughter

01:33:00.833 --> 01:33:02.666
has done something to him also.

01:33:04.416 --> 01:33:07.041
I wonder
how I've wronged Nithya.

01:33:11.666 --> 01:33:15.041
My daughter stared
at him the other day.

01:33:15.208 --> 01:33:16.625
Such an intense look!

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.958
He was little scared when
I asked him to go there today.

01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:24.291
Very sad.

01:33:24.458 --> 01:33:26.458
See how freaked out he looks.

01:33:31.041 --> 01:33:33.416
Now, what do we do, uncle?

01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:36.750
First, check if the bike
is there in front of the house.

01:33:37.083 --> 01:33:39.541
We will decide later
about going into the house.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.291
He even said that
he married her.

01:33:52.625 --> 01:33:54.666
Apparently,
she was pregnant too.

01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:56.708
Even today,
when we caught hold of him

01:33:56.958 --> 01:33:59.000
he took my mobile
and tried calling her.

01:33:59.458 --> 01:34:01.541
After that, like a mad man

01:34:01.708 --> 01:34:04.125
he started blabbering
and hitting us.

01:34:09.333 --> 01:34:12.125
First find out
about Anu's whereabouts.

01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:19.041
Careful. They should not
involve us for interrogation.

01:34:25.791 --> 01:34:28.125
For few days,
don't leave him alone.

01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:03.333
Come in.

01:35:11.291 --> 01:35:13.291
Hey! What are you doing here?

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:15.583
Come. We will go downstairs.
Come on.

01:35:24.583 --> 01:35:28.416
I don't know. I am finding
it difficult to breathe..

01:35:30.583 --> 01:35:32.375
For how long
have you been married?

01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:36.583
Only two months, sir.
- Only two months?

01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:39.250
Did you try at her mom's place?

01:35:39.416 --> 01:35:42.250
Sir, she has no parents
or relatives.

01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:49.958
Every months, nearly four cases
of wife eloping, is filed.

01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:51.541
Put a signature here.

01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:55.916
What happened is a guy
was suspicious over his wife.

01:35:56.875 --> 01:35:58.625
So, he killed his wife

01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:00.125
shot their child
and committed suicide.

01:36:00.416 --> 01:36:02.333
That house has been
locked since then.

01:36:02.583 --> 01:36:06.916
People nearby believe, there are
ghosts in that house.

01:36:07.375 --> 01:36:11.041
Two years back, two policemen
were found dead there.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.208
The case is still open
in the police department.

01:36:17.583 --> 01:36:19.541
These are the details
of that house.

01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:25.875
What about the small girl
who died? Is her name Nithya?

01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:33.041
The lady's name was Smita.
Kid's name..

01:36:34.208 --> 01:36:35.541
I will ask them to enquire.

01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:47.000
That day, the doctor
had prescribed it. Inhaler.

01:36:47.583 --> 01:36:49.500
Use it when you have
difficulty in breathing.

01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:52.333
You know how to use it, right?
- I know. Thanks!

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.791
Okay. I will take a shower
and be back.

01:36:57.958 --> 01:37:00.208
The watchman of this house
is a total drunkard, sir!

01:37:00.708 --> 01:37:03.083
He has rented out
the outhouse to them.

01:37:03.541 --> 01:37:06.291
I've seen Michael very often.

01:37:07.375 --> 01:37:10.041
I have hardly seen that girl.

01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:13.000
Both of them grew up
in an orphanage in Madurai.

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:14.333
When I asked him

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.541
he said they left the orphanage
five years back.

01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:19.250
It seems nobody in the orphanage
knew about their marriage.

01:37:19.541 --> 01:37:20.958
I enquired at the college.

01:37:21.166 --> 01:37:22.583
It seems she came
two months back

01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:24.291
to get her arrears application.

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.958
After that, there has
been no contact from her side.

01:37:27.583 --> 01:37:29.208
Nothing is clear.

01:37:29.375 --> 01:37:30.833
If we don't get any clue

01:37:31.166 --> 01:37:33.166
the way we enquire
will be completely different.

01:37:33.416 --> 01:37:35.625
If he himself has killed
and buried her?

01:37:35.791 --> 01:37:37.583
Sir, he is not
that kind of a person.

01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:42.125
Hey! There are people
who even kill infants. And you..

01:37:45.916 --> 01:37:48.291
Anu wouldn't have gone anywhere.
We will find her.

01:37:49.166 --> 01:37:52.166
Listen.
First, get out of that room.

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:54.416
If you continue staying there,
you'll keep thinking like this.

01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:57.666
First, come to work. Only then,
you will get some diversion.

01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:01.833
Hello! Pizza.

01:38:24.375 --> 01:38:26.083
No one is there.

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:30.166
Go.

01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:32.708
Go.

01:38:34.958 --> 01:38:36.875
That day, I had gone for
Kottiyokam delivery, remember?

01:38:37.208 --> 01:38:42.125
Around 10.30? At that time,
there was a sudden breeze.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:45.083
It felt like something
entered inside me.

01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:48.708
Some sort of bad smell.
I got frightened.

01:38:49.041 --> 01:38:51.833
Can you please send
Pandy for late night deliveries?

01:39:02.958 --> 01:39:04.583
Anything else, ma'am?
Thanks!

01:39:36.208 --> 01:39:39.208
Honestly, it's not bleeding.
- Nothing?

01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:46.208
Suddenly, he gets frightened.
He cries a lot thinking of her.

01:39:46.541 --> 01:39:48.875
He is asking me to check
if his back is bleeding.

01:39:50.041 --> 01:39:52.625
I feel sad looking at him suffer
in the room, uncle.

01:39:57.541 --> 01:39:59.500
Any news about that girl?

01:39:59.916 --> 01:40:04.250
No. - But, when we had gone
to shift his room

01:40:04.875 --> 01:40:06.875
there was no trace
of a girl having lived there.

01:40:07.208 --> 01:40:10.208
Right?
- Yes.

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:14.375
How much longer? Do you want
us to clear the body or not?

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.458
Don't come nearby.
Move, move, move.

01:40:16.916 --> 01:40:19.541
From morning onwards,
her body is there.

01:40:20.375 --> 01:40:21.541
Yes.

01:40:21.708 --> 01:40:25.250
Hey! What? Do you know her?
- No, Sir!

01:40:32.458 --> 01:40:35.166
Don't cry.
It's not her.

01:40:35.833 --> 01:40:38.250
Priya!
- Nithya! Nithya!

01:40:38.541 --> 01:40:40.625
Wait. Wait.
- Nithya! Nithya!

01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:45.750
You've committed a sin against
Nithya knowingly or unknowingly.

01:40:46.916 --> 01:40:49.541
Her evil spirit is furious

01:40:49.708 --> 01:40:52.291
and wants to avenge you.

01:40:53.541 --> 01:40:55.833
Whatever happened until now
and whatever is happening

01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:12.416
Even a murder could take place.

01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:16.083
If you agree,
I know a Malayali sorcerer.

01:41:25.291 --> 01:41:26.833
But, he never went to the house
from which the order had come.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.250
Like he said, his bike was
found outside this house itself.

01:41:32.083 --> 01:41:33.333
Shall we go inside
and just take it?

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.541
It's creepy but what else to do?

01:41:41.708 --> 01:41:46.583
Hey! It has already killed two.
Don't be hasty.

01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:50.916
It will indeed be inside.

01:42:07.791 --> 01:42:09.583
He is not troubled by ghosts.

01:42:09.916 --> 01:42:11.500
It doesn't look like
he is lying.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.541
But he has seen something
and has got terribly scared.

01:42:17.083 --> 01:42:19.750
He keeps talking
about a girl named Anu.

01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:21.875
If she is not found

01:42:22.416 --> 01:42:24.500
it will be difficult to bring
him back to normal.

01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:29.041
Does the girl
named Anu exist in reality?

01:42:31.541 --> 01:42:34.666
Has any one of you seen her?
- Why, sir?

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.250
That girl
could be an imaginary character.

01:42:39.583 --> 01:42:41.666
It could also be a ghost.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.625
Yes, sure.
Thank you.

01:42:50.416 --> 01:42:52.708
Hey, Mike!
Home delivery.

01:42:54.666 --> 01:42:55.625
Quick.

01:42:55.791 --> 01:42:56.833
Sir!
- Yes.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.541
Two medium chicken
delight for delivery.

01:42:58.708 --> 01:43:00.000
Okay, sir!

01:43:11.333 --> 01:43:12.833
Michael!

01:43:16.208 --> 01:43:17.916
Sir.
- Sit down.

01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:23.083
How are you?
- I am fine, sir.

01:43:23.833 --> 01:43:26.291
Going on a delivery errand?
- Yes, sir.

01:43:27.833 --> 01:43:29.541
Are you brave enough
to go these days?

01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:33.791
I can go. But I don't go
anywhere after 8 p.m.

01:43:35.125 --> 01:43:38.708
That day when I went out,
there was a sudden breeze.

01:43:39.541 --> 01:43:41.833
It was like something
entered inside me.

01:43:49.625 --> 01:43:53.666
It's a temple offertory.
Take it.

01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:57.208
Keep this under your pillow.
Pray to Goddess and sleep.

01:43:57.625 --> 01:44:00.583
Your fear will vanish.
It's very powerful.

01:44:04.791 --> 01:44:07.375
Hey!
Don't worry.

01:44:08.208 --> 01:44:10.416
Nothing would have
happened to Anu.

01:44:11.375 --> 01:44:13.041
Who knows what sin you had
committed because of which

01:44:13.208 --> 01:44:15.833
you're suffering so much
at this young age.

01:44:18.125 --> 01:44:21.291
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen.

01:44:21.833 --> 01:44:23.166
God will protect you.

01:44:23.333 --> 01:44:24.958
Be brave.

01:44:27.916 --> 01:44:29.875
Okay, sir.
- Go.

01:45:41.666 --> 01:45:45.625
Hello!
- Hey! How are you?

01:45:46.125 --> 01:45:48.583
Hey! How are you?

01:45:49.125 --> 01:45:52.375
There is no problem, right?
- I am fine. How are you?

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:57.375
I was very tensed.
Why didn't you call me?

01:45:57.791 --> 01:45:59.041
Even I was feeling the same.

01:45:59.208 --> 01:46:00.833
Is the situation favorable
for us to speak liberally?

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:14.583
Within half an hour, there will
be a raid in your office.

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:16.458
Shift the thing from that place.
- Hey!

01:46:17.291 --> 01:46:18.666
You are telling me now!

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:25.458
First, hide the thing. Don't try
to escape from the office.

01:46:25.625 --> 01:46:28.666
Someone could be watching you.
- Hey! I.. Hello!

01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.041
Michael!

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:01.916
Sir!

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.041
Give it at home.

01:47:06.208 --> 01:47:09.083
I'm going on a delivery errand.
Pandy can..

01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:11.750
My daughter won't kill you.
Go.

01:47:30.875 --> 01:47:32.291
Idiot!

01:47:33.166 --> 01:47:35.375
Hey! What happened?
- I fell down.

01:47:36.125 --> 01:47:37.916
Oh! What happened?

01:47:38.083 --> 01:47:41.833
Nothing. Nothing. I fell down.
My shirt became dirty.

01:47:41.958 --> 01:47:43.250
I can't go to the customer's
house like this.

01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:45.500
Check if the pizza is spilled.

01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:47.166
There is a scratch
at your back.

01:47:47.458 --> 01:47:48.416
Nothing.
- It's bleeding too.

01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:03.791
Make it fast.
It's too late.

01:48:04.458 --> 01:48:05.958
I should deliver
it within 15 minutes.

01:48:06.208 --> 01:48:07.791
Else, boss
might reduce my salary.

01:48:18.916 --> 01:48:20.541
Hey, Michael!

01:48:37.458 --> 01:48:39.666
It must be worth two crores!

01:48:42.291 --> 01:48:43.500
Let's take it and run away.

01:48:44.791 --> 01:48:47.625
Hey! Don't joke.
- Listen.

01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:50.500
We will have a baby
in few days.

01:48:50.666 --> 01:48:53.750
You will be selling pizza.
I have to pass my arrears.

01:48:53.958 --> 01:48:56.750
I will have to search
for a job too. Think well.

01:49:03.208 --> 01:49:05.791
If pizzas are not delivered
within 30 minutes

01:49:05.916 --> 01:49:07.666
you are not paid. Why?

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:09.958
Anything that is not received
at the right time is a waste.

01:49:10.458 --> 01:49:12.875
What is the use of becoming
rich at the age of 50?

01:49:13.041 --> 01:49:14.791
Using donated clothes
and food at the orphanage

01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:16.916
we have spent
half of your lives.

01:49:17.083 --> 01:49:19.750
We are going
to start a new life now.

01:49:20.833 --> 01:49:24.083
If not for ourselves,
at least, for our baby, Mike!

01:49:46.166 --> 01:49:48.833
With this money,
we can get fake passports

01:49:48.958 --> 01:49:50.916
fake visas and fake degrees.

01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:53.791
Till we get into the flight, we
will stay in a different city.

01:49:55.125 --> 01:49:56.708
Where will we go?

01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:59.958
We will go to Bangalore.

01:50:00.416 --> 01:50:02.125
There will be a bus now.

01:50:02.375 --> 01:50:04.250
First, we will leave this place.

01:50:04.583 --> 01:50:07.208
Within few minutes, they will
start searching for you.

01:50:33.291 --> 01:50:35.625
Okay. But we both should
not leave together.

01:50:35.791 --> 01:50:37.500
If anyone sees us,
doubts will arise.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.708
Till now,
they have not seen you.

01:50:39.958 --> 01:50:42.208
So, leave this place
after packing your things.

01:50:44.458 --> 01:50:46.250
I can't leave my vehicle
and come just like that.

01:50:46.416 --> 01:50:49.000
I should do something to it.
Then, I will leave by night.

01:50:49.166 --> 01:50:51.458
Tomorrow morning,
we will meet in Bangalore.

01:50:51.625 --> 01:50:54.041
Hey! If you get caught
even before boarding the bus?

01:50:55.041 --> 01:50:56.541
If I get caught?

01:51:00.666 --> 01:51:02.583
They will ask me
where I had been.

01:51:12.333 --> 01:51:13.958
They will enquire about
the vehicle and the bag.

01:51:14.125 --> 01:51:15.166
What will you say?

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:24.041
Accident?

01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:25.125
You are safe.

01:51:25.291 --> 01:51:26.375
How will the vehicle
alone meet with an accident?

01:51:27.291 --> 01:51:29.083
What if you said
that the vehicle was stolen?

01:51:31.625 --> 01:51:33.958
There will be a police complaint
and we will get caught.

01:51:36.875 --> 01:51:38.083
I should tell them a story
that they might believe.

01:51:38.250 --> 01:51:39.916
So that, it will be
easier for us to escape.

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:48.333
Ghost story?

01:51:50.166 --> 01:51:51.708
Hey!

01:51:52.875 --> 01:51:55.083
Everyone has got a weakness.

01:51:55.333 --> 01:51:57.958
Money for some people.
God for some people.

01:51:58.333 --> 01:51:59.791
Girls for some people.

01:52:00.083 --> 01:52:02.625
What about your boss?

01:52:04.708 --> 01:52:07.166
It's ghost, spirit, devils.

01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:19.458
You have read my novel.

01:52:20.125 --> 01:52:23.875
In that, your boss,
his daughter and some bungalow.

01:52:24.541 --> 01:52:26.583
Include everything and
tell them a reliable story.

01:52:26.833 --> 01:52:27.875
That day, on that TV channel

01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:29.291
they had told about
some haunted bungalow, right?

01:52:29.791 --> 01:52:30.708
Smita bungalow.

01:52:30.875 --> 01:52:32.125
Which name did Priya call out
the other day?

01:52:32.291 --> 01:52:33.791
Nithya!

01:52:40.333 --> 01:52:43.333
Enough? You can direct
a ghost film with all these.

01:52:44.208 --> 01:52:46.333
That's right.
If they ask me about my wife?

01:52:47.833 --> 01:52:50.708
Say something and handle them.
First, let's leave from here.

01:52:51.875 --> 01:52:54.083
Hey! Careful.

01:53:27.833 --> 01:53:31.583
Did you board the bus? Stop
thinking about me. I am fine.

01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:36.208
I will come by bus or by train.
Are you safe? Okay.

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:53.833
Hello! Hey, Michael!
- Who?

01:53:54.166 --> 01:53:56.166
I am Shanmugam speaking.

01:53:56.458 --> 01:53:58.291
Sir!
- What is it?

01:53:58.875 --> 01:54:00.250
Customer called up and said,
the delivery hasn't reached yet.

01:54:00.416 --> 01:54:01.791
Lakshmi said you haven't
reached home yet.

01:54:02.083 --> 01:54:03.833
Your phone wasn't reachable
either. Where are you?

01:54:03.958 --> 01:54:07.708
Hello!
- Sir, I got trapped..

01:54:07.875 --> 01:54:10.458
What? Delivery? - Sir!

01:54:10.625 --> 01:54:12.166
Hello! I am not able to hear.

01:54:12.333 --> 01:54:13.583
Where are you?
Is there any problem?

01:54:14.041 --> 01:54:15.708
I got trapped in the house..

01:54:16.291 --> 01:54:17.958
What? House?
- Sir!

01:54:18.125 --> 01:54:21.083
Hello! - Sir, can you hear me?
- Hello! - Sir!

01:54:22.333 --> 01:54:24.541
What is this?
He sounds shaken up.

01:54:24.833 --> 01:54:26.208
Check if he has fallen
from the bike.

01:54:26.375 --> 01:54:29.958
Sir! Please don't cut the call.
Sir! Don't. Please!

01:54:33.791 --> 01:54:36.750
Hey, Raghava!
Call me the moment you find him.

01:54:37.125 --> 01:54:38.583
Okay.

01:55:03.125 --> 01:55:05.541
It can't be an accident.

01:55:05.708 --> 01:55:08.125
Else, we would have
got the news by now.

01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:12.666
I know the area.
We can find his house easily.

01:55:18.708 --> 01:55:21.583
We'll go to the police then.
- He doesn't know what's inside.

01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:24.125
Uncle is constantly calling us
to ask if we have found him.

01:55:24.333 --> 01:55:26.416
What do I answer him?

01:55:29.416 --> 01:55:33.500
Michael, where had you been?
- Anu, is missing. - Nothing.

01:55:33.875 --> 01:55:35.291
I need to go.

01:55:37.166 --> 01:55:40.208
Don't, sir. No.
I must look for Anu.

01:55:48.166 --> 01:55:50.250
He is there inside.
Go and see.

01:55:54.041 --> 01:55:57.458
"You are running somewhere."

01:55:57.833 --> 01:56:00.916
"You are searching
for something."

01:56:01.916 --> 01:56:04.333
"When fear crosses the border.."

01:56:05.791 --> 01:56:08.333
"You start singing
devotional song.." Sir, Anu..

01:56:10.166 --> 01:56:17.083
"Oh! there is no life
without desires in heart."

01:56:22.708 --> 01:56:25.666
"...there is no life."

01:56:27.375 --> 01:56:34.916
"Only love can quench
the thirst."

01:56:35.083 --> 01:56:42.416
"If time comes,
even ghost will possess you."

01:56:42.583 --> 01:56:45.375
"You just close your eyes."

01:56:46.958 --> 01:56:54.500
"Oh! there is no life
without desires in heart."

01:56:54.875 --> 01:57:02.750
"Oh! Once desires arise
there is no life in heart."

01:57:05.625 --> 01:57:09.875
Sir.. Sir..
There is someone there.

01:57:18.791 --> 01:57:21.166
Sir, is it bleeding here?

01:57:24.375 --> 01:57:25.958
Honestly, it's not bleeding.

01:57:26.166 --> 01:57:29.041
Do not worry. Nothing would
have happened to Anu.

01:57:39.333 --> 01:57:40.791
Our passports are also ready.

01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:43.041
Within two days my degree
certificate will also be ready.

01:57:48.458 --> 01:57:50.666
Too many things are happening
here unlike what we had thought.

01:57:51.125 --> 01:57:52.708
Everyone has
started to believe me.

01:57:53.208 --> 01:57:54.958
When will you come?
- I don't know.

01:57:55.125 --> 01:57:57.166
It could be two weeks
or even two months.

01:57:57.833 --> 01:57:59.625
But I'll make everyone
here believe me

01:57:59.791 --> 01:58:01.625
and escape from
here smoothly. Okay?

01:58:01.791 --> 01:58:04.083
Before that if they opened
that house to check?

01:58:04.583 --> 01:58:05.416
No chance.

01:58:05.583 --> 01:58:07.458
Till the time Shanmugam
has got fear for ghosts

01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:10.708
till his daughter is possessed
by Nithya, we are safe.

01:58:12.041 --> 01:58:13.416
Do you know something?

01:58:13.708 --> 01:58:16.291
As far as they are concerned
there is no girl called Anu.

01:58:16.583 --> 01:58:17.541
They are thinking that
she herself is a ghost.

01:58:17.708 --> 01:58:21.208
They are thinking at that level.
Are you a ghost?

01:58:22.083 --> 01:58:25.625
Yes. All the dangerous ghosts
in this world are still alive.

01:58:26.125 --> 01:58:27.500
In the form of human beings
like us.

01:58:27.666 --> 01:58:30.375
Hey, you called my
novel as a lousy one.

01:58:30.708 --> 01:58:32.625
The value of that is two crores.
Did you realize that?

01:58:33.708 --> 01:58:35.958
Even now,
I'll say it's a lousy novel.

01:58:36.166 --> 01:58:37.458
The way I narrated it
is amazing.

01:58:37.625 --> 01:58:40.666
Hey, you are a real coward.
How did you manage?

01:58:40.916 --> 01:58:43.750
Only a scared person can narrate
a scary story and scare others.

01:58:46.333 --> 01:58:47.458
I'll talk to you
after two days. Okay?

01:58:47.708 --> 01:58:49.791
Talk to me for some more time.

01:58:50.791 --> 01:58:52.458
No. If my phone remained
switched off for too long

01:58:55.458 --> 01:58:56.333
When?

01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.000
Whenever it's possible.
Be safe.

01:58:59.166 --> 01:59:02.291
Take care. I love you. Bye!
- Me too.

01:59:02.875 --> 01:59:04.083
Take care.
Bye!

02:01:17.041 --> 02:01:20.625
Ma'am, pizzas.
- Come and keep it inside.

02:01:24.625 --> 02:01:25.666
How much?

02:01:30.416 --> 02:01:32.750
Rs.435, Ma'am.
- Okay.

02:01:48.625 --> 02:01:52.458
Nithya! Nithya! The pizzas
are delivered. Go and see.

02:01:54.333 --> 02:01:58.125
"Cheating.. Cheating.."

02:01:59.291 --> 02:02:02.875
"Cheating.. Cheating.."

02:02:04.833 --> 02:02:06.666
Nithya!

02:02:39.166 --> 02:02:55.916
"The heart is thinking."

02:02:56.625 --> 02:03:02.208
"It's beating."

02:03:02.375 --> 02:03:07.375
"It catches."

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:39.750
"For us, we got our life."

02:04:15.666 --> 02:04:24.083
"Daily after that, it's good".

02:04:24.250 --> 02:04:32.916
"Will it help?"

02:04:34.458 --> 02:04:40.916
"Anything in life."
