00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.680
Dad..tell me a story dad.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.760
Story..?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.080
Which one did I say last time?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.700
Abhminayu-Sasirekha...
What should I say now..?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.160
-Dear, shall I tell you a good story?
-Yeah..tell..

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.840
Ok. Once upon a time, there was a saint
called Kanva Maharshi.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.220
He raised a girl named Shakuntala,
like his own Daughter.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.640
Kanva Maharshi likes Shakuntala a lot.
She was his life.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.020
Shakuntala also likes Kanva Maharshi a lot..

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.500
So, are they like us..!?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.400
Yeah dear..like us only..like us only..ok?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.820
As time passed by, one day, a king named
Dushyantha Maharaj..

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.440
..visited Kanva Maharshi's ashram.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.660
Despite of feeling very sad as a father,
Kanva Maharshi sent Shakuntala away.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.960
Why did he send her away then..?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.040
He could've kept both of them
with him only right..?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.400
[satirically]Yeah..right..
Didn't I come leaving my father after marriage?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.580
It's the same with you too. After marriage,
you also should leave your father and go away.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.820
-[irritated]Akhila! Akhila!

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.760
-It's almost school time, wake up!
-Let her..Let her sleep..

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
Why are you doing her homework daily?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.020
-Will you go to school and write exams for her?
-How can she complete so much homework? Poor girl..

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020
-Wake her up! Take her to school.
-You go..you go..

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.220
-You are pampering her too much.
-I'll wake her up.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.660
I can't take this anymore.
Aunty, at least you tell them..

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.700
..it's getting late.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.240
Take her school bag and you go sit in her class.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.100
-Mom, reduce your voice..she's asleep..
-You won't let her do homework..

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100
..won't let her wake up early..

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.700
I seriously doubt if you would
send her away after marriage.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.920
-I won't send her away..
-Don't..!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.040
Keep her with you only.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.460
This is 11th time you are late to
school this month, you know?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.480
If all students are coming on time,
why you alone are coming late?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.460
Ok, you go to class.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.100
Mr. Arun Prasad, I've written many times in diary..

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.480
complained to you..

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.200
Being a lecturer, why are you letting her get late?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.040
Early morning 8:30 am...is getting too tough
for my daughter ma'am..

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.860
What do you suggest?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.280
If the school opens around 9, 9:30 or 10 am..
it'd be nice..

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.700
Of course, it's your decision.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.440
Oh! Ok.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.640
Tomorrow come sharp at 10'o clock,
I'll give her TC.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.140
Then you can let her sleep how much
ever time you want.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.160
Sharp 8:30 ma'am.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.060
I'll drop Akhila at sharp 8:30am. From tomorrow
she'll never be late again.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.100
I promise.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.840
I'll see you again.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.460
Bro, Akhila is coming out. Give her the letter.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.460
Bro, give bro!!

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440
Is it a leave letter?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.040
No..love letter.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.200
Is it for me?

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.240
Hey, why are you leaving without saying anything?

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.020
I have to show it to my dad, right?

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.720
No no..don't show it to your dad..please.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.100
[laughing] Who's this boy?

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.300
-To prepare and write this is not a question paper-
-Dad, look at this-

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.580
-What happened? What's that?
-Nothing..I'm eating mixture...

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.320
-Why are you guys laughing?
-Mixture mixture...she said a joke..so..

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.420
Whatever...

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.880
-Bye dad. Will see you soon.
-Bye dear. Go to class.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.980
Dad...

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.880
He's the one who gave me the letter.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.420
-Oh my god! Bro, I'm going to class.
-Bye bro..

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.320
-How did you write your exam?
-Good sir..

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.700
You study 8th class right?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.680
Tomorrow, if they give you 10th class question
paper in 8th class exam, can you answer it?

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.220
I can't...

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.000
In this age, love is also like 10th class
question paper.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.020
You won't understand...you can't write. Now go...

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.600
-I won't do it again..Ok?
-Stop it...

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.140
Ok..what do you want to become in future?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.300
I'll...study engineering..and go to America..

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.060
Will you leave me and go..?

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.180
Yeah...

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.160
I've got heart attack for a second..

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.740
You're brilliant dear...

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.960
Brilliant students like you should
prepare for IAS only.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.100
IAS!? No no dad.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.800
I'm not at all interested.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.580
I'll..become an engineer.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.900
-What is this Keshav?
-Mom..

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.620
You said in a year the company is getting shut down and
you are vacating the house..why did you bring us here then?

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.380
We still have a year mom.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.140
But I like living here only.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.000
Look at this breeze, environment and calmness..
you won't find this in city mom.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.500
-You're right.
-Akhila..

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.860
You'll love this place. It's very peaceful here.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.740
This is the right place for her studies.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.480
It's very silent, right..

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.980
-Are children at home?
-Yeah Mom.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.880
Come come..

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.160
Are you doing good aunty?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.400
I'm fine dear.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.840
Natya, take your bag..

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.760
-Daddy..
-What? Wait..

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.720
-Are you doing good? Sit..Natya, take your books.
-Come come come...are you studying well?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.400
Sit...

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.180
-Aunty, do you want coffee or tea?
-Get me Coffee dear.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.220
Coffee for you. For you dear?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.900
I don't want anything aunty.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.980
I'll get you milk.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.220
Natya?

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.360
You remember my name?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.160
Come come..

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.460
This is my room..yours too..

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.540
This is my bed..yours too..

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.140
This is my wardrobe..you can use it too..

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.620
-Natya!
-Yeah...

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.180
Natya! Sister is here to study for IAS.
You shouldn't disturb her.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.260
You and Chinnu shouldn't increase TV volume..

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.600
Shouldn't make noise. Ok?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.360
-Go..it's time for school.
-Bye dad.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.440
Feel this like your home dear.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.920
You won't have any trouble.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.540
If you want something..ask me.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.760
I'll arrange.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.480
I know how important IAS is for you.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.740
Tomorrow, I'll take you to institute.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.540
<i>Love is not a beauty that brings
your eyes together..
</i>

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.440
<i>but it's a feeling that wins over your heart...
</i>

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.160
<i>It's not easy to achieve for anyone..
</i>

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.800
<i>but if you did it's a truth that never gets erased..
</i>

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.280

</i>

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.720
<i>It's not an illusion..

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.540
<i>It doesn't have any fears..
</i>

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.220
<i>It's not at all a burden..</i>

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.520
What bro!?

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.560
-Have you slept well?
-Shut up..

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.000
[calls out] Your dad..

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.140
[calls out]

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.820
-Dad..
-Come here..

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.660
Sit..

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.300
Dad..night my friends forced me..so..

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.160
If they force, will you drink drainage water?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.180
No way! Why would I drink drainage water dad?

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.000
Enough with this stupid friends and music stuff.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.940
-From today onwards, you are coming to book store.
-Dad..!!

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.620
What will I do at the book store dad?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.100
Please dad, I won't come to book store.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.200
If you want I'll go to Bangalore and stay with uncle.
I'll look for a job over there.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.720
Just wait for 2 months dad..please.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.620
Get ready..you are coming to book store.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.480
<i>My life has changed...</i>
<i>Something is happening in me...</i>

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.980
<i>My mind is lost...</i>

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.640
-Drive the car. Here's your carriage.
<i>Something has happened to me...</i>

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.860
<i>Loser!!</i>

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.980
My son..he is going to work here.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.280
Is it only for today sir or..?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.900
Not only for today..

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.120
...from today he is going to work with us here.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.760
It seems we are opening a new branch in
Secunderabad. Are you going to look after it sir?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.700
I'll ask you something, be frank

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.780
Do I look like a guy who sells books?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.300
My dad is selling books not knowing
what else to do..

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.740
..and I'm daily bringing him lunch to make
my mom happy.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.120
For this, will you label me as a book seller?

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.420
I have lot of plans for the future.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.960
-Yeah that's for me...
-Here's the change...

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.480
<i>One time, two times, three times, four times..
My life is screwed up..
</i>

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.540
Do you know our wifi password?

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.820
-Yes sir.
-Good, tell..

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.020
Father ordered me not to tell you sir..
can you please move sir?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.820
<i>Without Wifi, Without Facebook...</i>

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.160
-Read this book..it'll help you in life.
<i>..without Whatsapp, life is a waste...</i>

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.440
<i>There is no connection, there is no chatting,
there is no Face time...Life is a waste..</i>

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.380
<i>Life is..Life is..taken away from me..
</i>

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.500
<i>My life has changed similar to books in library..
</i>

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.780
<i>Life is..Life is..taken away from me..
</i>

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.800
<i>My life has changed similar to books in library..
</i>

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.320
<i>Lord Brahma wrote my fate when he was sleepy..</i>

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.920
<i>He's so jealous of me that
he jailed me in this library..
</i>

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.500
<i>I was waiting for my name to appear in books..
</i>

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.100
<i>But my life has become like
a waste paper in dust bin.
</i>

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.000
<i>It's gone..It's gone..My life is completely changed..
</i>

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.220
<i>What else is left in this world for me?</i>

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.140
<i>It's gone..It's gone..My life is completely changed</i>

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.040
-Park the car and stay inside only. I'll be back.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.120
-Come fast. Do I have another option?

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.400
<i>What else is left in this world for me..?</i>

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.540
-[calls out] Amar! Where are you going?
-Dad..?

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.740
Get in..let's go...get inside..

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.560
Please dad..I'll be back in a minute.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.320
We have to open the book store? What's the urgency?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.680
Do you need to pee?

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.480
-Dad, not that dad..
-Let's go

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.880
Mom...

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.220
I need to say you something.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.260
We'll talk after the serial is over.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.800
Mom!!

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.860
Is serial more important than your son?

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.620
Ok..tell

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.420
Actually...

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.220
I saw a girl today mom.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.800
A girl..!?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.960
Who's she?

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.520
When me and Dad are going to
book store in the morning...

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.240
..he had some work and we stopped at a place.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.980
I saw a girl there..

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.240
I felt like I've found something that I lost mom..

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.440
Do you know where she lives?

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.300
Actually..I wanted to follow her mom..

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.080
..but dad came at the same time and
took me to book store.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.400
No problem. Go to the same bus stop tomorrow..
you'll meet her for sure.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.760
I have lot of work left to do..finish your food.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.180
Shall I serve you dinner?

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.020
[calls out]

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.500
-Yeah dad..
-Deposit this cheque in bank account.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.720
Yeah, ok dad

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.860
-Do you know in which account?
-Yeah..our account only..

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.720
[calls out]

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.440
This is our account's cheque..

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.820
..deposit it in JB publications account.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.340
-Ok
-What ok?

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.160
Tomorrow's saturday..banks are open
until 1pm only...

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.720
You have to deposit the cheque before that time.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.840
Don't irritate me repeating the same thing dad.
I said I'll deposit, right? You relax.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.700
Let's see what you'll do..

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.820
Bro, why are you looking there
when I'm talking here...

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.300
Hey, Amar!

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.640
-Bro..?
-Hey, you said you have some work, right?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.880
-Go take care of it first...
-Where are you looking bro?

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.840
-Bro, wait for a minute. I have some work with you..
-Please bro..

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.200
-I have to talk something with you bro. Stay..
-Bro, please let me go..

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.520
-Just stay bro...
-Please bro..

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.380
Just stay..we'll go out..

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.000
Yeah, cheque is deposited in the bank.
I sent my son in person.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.500
It should've been credited.
You can check now.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.320
Is it? Then..

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.060
Hey..you've deposited cheque
in the bank right?

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.940
Which cheque dad?

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.660
Bank was closed by the time I got there dad.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.560
What time did you go?

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.560
I told you specifically that it's Saturday,
bank will close at 1pm.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.880
Without common sense if you go lately,
why would they keep it open?

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.460
What do you think of yourself?
I'm talking here....

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.640
-Fill up that rack..
-Ok sir

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.180
Hey, answer the phone..phone..phone..

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.460
Useless phone..

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.580
Books? Sorry, this is not a book store.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.460
Sorry, you've reached wrong number.
Thank you.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.140
Hi ma'am.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.140
What books do you need ma'am?

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.960
-Geography of India, Indian History for UPSC
-I'll get them immediately.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.060
Where are those books?

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.340
What are you searching for?

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.480
Yeah dad..she said something about
Geography..History and stuff..

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.300
-Is it for Civils?
-Yeah dad..

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.000
-You don't know where they are right?
-No..

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.180
Over there.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.420
When did he work in the first place, to know
where they are.. Look at how he's searching..

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:31.160
All the fiction books, shift them to
ground floor rack.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.160
They are highly in demand. So..

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.460
..give preference to them and plan accordingly.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.020
-I don't think they have it here.
-It's already too late, right?

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.340
Yeah..

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.680
Do you have this book?

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.160
- I think he got it..
-He's here

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.500
I'm very sorry ma'am. We just have this one.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.580
You've asked for Geography book, right?

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.840
It'll be here by tomorrow morning 10am.
Ok ma'am?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.840

Bhaskar!

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.160
-Sir?
-Come fast..

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.940
Yeah coming sir..

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.460
There's a discount on this book, just a minute.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.940
He's Bhaskar. I'm the boss and he's my worker.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.000
Bhaskar, they will come at 10am tomorrow morning.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.200
-The book should be delivered to us by 9pm tonight. Ok?
-Ok sir

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.420
Offer is 10% ma'am. 200 rupees ma'am.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.980
10% out of 285 brings it to 200?

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.380
-Yes ma'am
-Is this a special discount?

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.800
Yes, special discount ma'am.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.140
-Ok ma'am
-One second..

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.120
If you give your name, phone number and details,
we will call you tomorrow-

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.700
[sarcastically] Do you also need her zodiac sign,
caste, religion and other stuff too?

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.600
This is just to remind you tomorrow morning..

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.220
Not necessary. We'll only come and take it.
Give the bill.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.320
Here's the bill..

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.560
He's doing a lot of extras..

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.340
By the way, I think you are working way too hard..?
-It's not like that dad.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.460
You only asked me to take care of some work
instead of sitting idle right dad?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.280
That's why I'm selling our books..

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.500
Dad, if you can please..

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.540
What sir? Are you waiting for that girl?

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.760
What girl?

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.380
That girl sir...

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.040
..when she asked for two books yesterday,
you gave one and hid the other one right? That girl..

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.040
Oh, you saw that?

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.160
Yes sir.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.540
It's my small plan to meet her again.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.840
-But you missed out on a small detail sir.
-What's that?

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.600
Advance.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.780
If you had taken 400 rupees advance,
they would've come today for sure sir.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.920
Won't she come now?

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.900
There are many other stores in this area sir.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.400
She might've bought at anyplace and left.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.100
You should've given me this idea yesterday right?

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.300
You are the boss..I'm just a worker.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.680
I thought it's not manners..

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.100
Dad, I need a day off tomorrow.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:43.820
Why?

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.360
I have some work to do.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.620
-What work do you have?
-Dad..just for tomorrow.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.880
Ok..we'll see.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.120
I'm serious dad. I can't come tomorrow.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.960
-What is there to see in it?
-I'm serious too.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.360
We'll see..we'll see.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.540
Whatever. I'm not gonna come.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.080
We'll see where you'll go without coming.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.080
Dad, just 2 minutes. I'll be right back.
Please wait here.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.720
-Hey, Where are you going?
-I'll be right back...wait dad.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Stop!

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.500
[calls out]

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.160
[calls out loudly]

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.440
Where are you going stopping car
in middle of the road.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.440
[calls out] Come back..

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.080
In today's class, sir told he'll
continue this topic only..

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.540
-What is he doing here?
-What ma'am..?

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.280
You didn't show up to take the book.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.740
I was waiting for you since then..

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.540
We asked for it..so?
Will no one else buy it if not for us?

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.760
Even if they want it, we won't sell it.
Work ethics.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.900
Here, take the book ma'am.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.900
After discount it's 860 rupees. You don't need
to pay right away.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.200
We'll take care of it later.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.100
He's doing a lot of over action.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.960
Actually, you don't even need to pay ma'am.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.420
You look like you are seriously preparing for IAS.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.320
By the way, what is your name ma'am?

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.360
Fine..not necessary.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:12.560
Will see you soon..

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.320
[shouting in joy] Sister is here!!

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.620
Come let's play sister! Please..

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.740
<i>I am moving towards you like a stream..</i>

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.880
<i>leaving myself behind..for you..
</i>

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.200
<i>I found out for the first time today..</i>

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.300
<i>that the coast I've dreamt of is you..

<i>Colors of happiness spreading in all my directions..

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.560
<i>I've slipped like t he first rain drop

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.620
Dad..

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.780
I want to do IAS.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.540
Ok dad, I'll keep selling books.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.300
Bro, she's coming. Shut up and be quiet.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.480
<i>Do you know that because of you...
my behavior has changed..
</i>

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.640
<i>I've lost control of my heart because of you..
</i>

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.900
<i>Like a miracle that's never heard of..</i>

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:29.020
<i>your speed has joined my heart
without any notice..

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.000
<i>Your fragrance touches my every breath..

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.220
<i>You are the relation that's going to
keep me alive from now on..

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.380

<i>I'll never leave your direction again like a storm..
</i>

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.080
Will Secunderabad bus come this way sir?

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.660
<i>I'll change into a flash that doesn't
stand in front of you..
</i>

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.640
What's with this heat sir?

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.420
-I couldn't sleep yesterday night.
<i>I'll come in every step of yours...</i>

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.060
<i>..like a light, My Queen..
</i>

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.000
Is the boss there yet?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.720
I'm coming man, I'm at the bus stop.
Yeah..

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.160
My aunt stays here only sir.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.860
They only called and asked me to come.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.820
That's why I'm here.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.500
Bro, you cut the call.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.480
Do you know me sir?

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.820
No sir.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.820
Should we come to office daily on time or what?

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.660
-Bus is on it's way. I'm waiting for that only what's the hurry?
-Bro

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.560
..what's wrong with my aunty's family?

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.800
-They are asking me to come daily..
-Bro, he's back again, wait on the line.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.800
-He's done..
-Since childhood it's like this only.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.360
They like me a lot.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.920
That's why I come here daily.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.490
<i>My heart woke up this morning for you only..
</i>

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.960
-Bro, let's go to aunty's house bro.
-I have to take the bus sir.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.460
-Show me your aunty's house bro.
-Go straight and take left..

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.420
-What straight and left? Show me.
..bus is leaving.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.240
-Leave me..
-Stop bro..I'll also come to aunty's house..

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.800
Bro, what happened?

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.680
She slapped you good dude.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.260
That's ok..it was her only right?

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.540
When everyone in the bus was scolding you..

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.240
..you could've told it was not you who touched, right?

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.060
Poor girl. Everyone would scold her if I had told that.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.660
I don't like that.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.400
Whatever happened is happened.
Did she at least say sorry?

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.380
She could have..but before that
this idiot brought me here.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.300
Why bro?

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.540
Idiot! You are pushing this on me?

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.540
If I hadn't rescued you then,
they would have smashed you.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.620
Does she at least know your name?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.360
She might not..but I know where she lives...

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.680
Aren't you feeling ashamed for being
slapped by a girl?

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.380
-Dudes..Do you know what happened there?
-We know...

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.140
Hey be quiet buddy...

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.220
Do you know how bad she felt for slapping me..?

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.660
Eyes were about to tear up...

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.260
Your eyes?

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.640
Most of the love stories began with sorry only.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.040
So according to this..

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.480
..she would spend the entire night
feeling sorry for slapping me..

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.180
and she may come tomorrow and say sorry..

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.700
How far our editing has been completed?

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.700
We felt a part of it was not good right?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.700
-Will look into that after this..
-Ok, first-

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.420
Bloody hell..

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.220
Bro, how much longer? I'm getting irritated.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.160
Poor girl..she might have cried all night for
slapping me and slept late.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.340
-That's why she might be late..
-My foot..!

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.140
-Don't you feel this is too much?
-Why are you doing over action?

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.340
-Wait and watch. She'll come..
-You idiot!

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.480
Bus has left two hours ago.
Just wait and watch it seems..

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.900
That girl..

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.580
Do you think she went to Archies
to get me a sorry gift?

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.300
Get your hand off me...off..

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.360
-What happened bro?
-You have gone completely mad..I am leaving.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.000
Hey Bujji, please buddy...
Ok..ok..

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.680
-Ok, let's go
-I'll not come, you go.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.880
Bro? Ok..

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.880
We'll go once and take a look at her bro...

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.880
Take a look at her? Do you think they
arranged a match-making event for you?

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.880
-I can't take this..
-Fine fine... Ok Ok..

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.660
That's fine...Hey Bujji...

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.480
That girl..

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.440
Do you think she felt sad for slapping me..

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.480
..and stopped going to the institute?

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.820
-I realized one thing after watching you bro..
-What's that?

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.480
-Love will damage your brain..

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.740
-It's not like that dude..
-Get the hell out of here...

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.240
Give an idea to go to her house bro..

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.180
Yes grandma!

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.940
Bhakthi channel's not coming?

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.860
I am at Secunderabad, it will take a
lot of time for me to come there.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.500
I'll come once I'm there.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.080
Ok.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.340
This old lady thinks she can call 60 times a day
and eat my brain if she pays bill once a month.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.000
I'm getting a severe headache...
Hey, give me a tea..

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.180
-What do you think she is doing at home bro?
-How would I know..mind your business.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.460
What are you doing here sir?

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.520
What are you doing here?

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.060
I handle all cable connections in
this area sir.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.960
-Cable?
-Yes sir.

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.960
-Cable it seems bro..
-What are you thinking now!?

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.300
-Bro, is this necessary now?
-Keep quiet and come bro..

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.140
-Bro..I look fine, right?
-[sarcastically] Yeah..super handsome..

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.280
Who are you?

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.920
-We are cable guys...got phone..
-Yeah, go inside.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.460
Aunty, cable guys are here?

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.000
Come..

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.480
Is there anyone at home?

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.880
-Bro..no bro. I am scared, please let me go...
-Wait bro..

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.840
-Bro, please bro.
-Excuse me..

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.640
-If they find out they will smash us bro.
-What..

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.520
Who is that...?

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.580
Cable repair grandma.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.940
Where is that waste fellow?

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.480
-He is sick grandma..
-Obviously..

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.260
He will be fine when it comes to take payment..

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.400
How many ever times I call, he says all
cock and bull stories.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.500
That is, he is really sick, so..

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.320
What? Why are you peeping inside
when I am talking to you?

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.620
-TV..I was looking for TV.
-TV is inside the house only.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.780
The thing you need to repair is on the terrace. Go..

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.040
Why the hell am I carrying this cable and bag bro?

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.720
Come bro..
Mahesh, I am on the terrace. What should I do?

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.180
Search for the amplifier sir.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.600
Yeah...found it.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.360
Careful..!

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.300
-Bro, she is over there.
-Finish this work first.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.300
I can't see her properly bro..

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.020
Grandma, is it working?

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.400
Let me take a look.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.680
Yeah! It's working.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.620
Thank god its working. We can leave now.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.820
Shit! It's gone again...

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.700
What the hell are you doing bro?
Do you want to stay here all day?

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.520
First of all, does this old lady need a TV?

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.000
Grandma, is it working?

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.820
-Yeah...it's working.
-Wow.. We can leave now.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.020
Shit... It's gone again.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.020
Bro, I can't see her properly from here...

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.300
-So, will you go down now?
-Grandma..

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.840
..the problem is downstairs. Wait, I'm coming down.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.080
-Yeah..make it quick.
-Unnecessarily I only gave the idea..

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.100
Bro, let's go down.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.460
-Go outside and check..

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.180
Hello... What are you doing here?

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.960
That is..uhh..cable repair..

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.480
-It's my part-time job, ma'am.
-Enough!

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.360
It's not what you think ma'am..

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.960
I didn't feel much when you slapped me on that day, but..

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.100
you might want to say sorry, right..

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.160
Why should I say sorry?

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.240
-I think she is right bro..
-You shut up.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.680
You slapped me unknowingly right..so..

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.900
It happened accidentally yesterday..

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.700
If you come to my house and disturb again..

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.920
-Next time..
-[calls out] Is the work completed?

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.140
-Yes grandma.
-Working on it grandma.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.560
-Working on it grandma..
-I don't get it.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.220
You say you are working, but
I couldn't see the picture.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.100
Careful bro.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.100
He fell down. What are you doing?

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.100
How can you push him like that and leave?

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.400
What!? At least say sorry.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.900
-Are you satisfied?
-Ok.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.260
You come dear..

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.960
-By the way..
-Yeah grandma..

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.180
-What did you say your name was?
-Amar grandma..

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.500
-Amar...!! Shall I go and see if the picture is coming?
-Yeah grandma..

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.520
Bro, enough of these atrocities bro..let's leave.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520
Haa... It's working.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.200
-Thank god! It's working it seems.
-Ok grandma..

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.640
Bro, did she push me or did you pull the stool?

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.080
-Have you gone blind? She only pushed you.
-[irritated] Let's go..

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.340
Are you happy?
She pushed you intentionally and left

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.180
Bro... She is there...

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.320
Don't look that side.
We will leave Grandma..

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.600
-Ok go..
-Bye grandma.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.040
-[calls out]
-Yes grandma..

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.860
I will call you if the picture doesn't come.
Write your number and go.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.340
Ok grandma.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.600
-Grandma!!
-Yeah..

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.240
I am writing under this switch board..

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.980
....if there is any need call me.
Ok? Right under this switch board.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.160
Why are you shouting like I'm deaf?
I'm here only right?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.640
-That's not for you grandma..
-What..?

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.200
-Nothing grandma..bro, you come.
-I mean he wrote the number..take a look and call him..

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200
Don't forget to call grandma...phone..phone..

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.940
By the way, you said you will start a new branch...
What happened to that?

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.080
I thought about it..loan also got sanctioned
and the place is set too

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.080
..but who will look after it?

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.980
-What dear..How's that girl?
-I am busy at this store.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.380
-Girl? What girl mom?
-He is still very irresponsible.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.380
-Wow! What an acting bro!
-What should I say?

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.380
-That girl bro..
-Oh! That girl?

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.940
I'm trying mom...Let's see.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.480
Chinni, answer the call.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.880
You only answer.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.260
[sternly] Answer the phone!!

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.300
After Google came into existence, I lost the reading habit..

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.600
[in phone] Hey idiot! TV is not working again.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.420
[in phone] Chaganti's program is coming..

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.940
[in phone] If you don't come immediately and repair it..

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.680
[in phone]..I'll cut the cable connection.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.020
-[in phone] What!?
-Hey idiot!

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.020
TV is not working at someone's place it seems.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.560
You've not repaired it properly it seems, right?

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.440
-They are asking you to quit if you
don't know how to repair.
-He got caught

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.260
Hey! Give me the phone.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.960
Yeah grandma..I'm coming.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.760
I'll not at all come this time. You only go.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.820
We'll just go once and come back bro.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.440
Aren't you getting vexed with this?

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.200
If we come daily, they will think we are watchmen.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.020
Please bro. We'll come back in 10minutes.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.360
No way, I'll not come. That Granny will be there,
I'll be dead if she sees me.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.420
Ok, do one thing.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.120
You wait for half an hour. I'll go meet grandma,
set that girl and come back.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.900
Bro..If you are even late by one second,
I'll leave with the bike.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.020
-Thanks Bujji
-Why bro?

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.820
-How will you go now?
-Hey!! Keys?

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.320
-I'll come back bro.
-No, I'll not give.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.700
-I'll come back bro..
-I'm sure you won't come. I'll not give.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.720
Leave my hand.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.600
-What happened grandma? You called..
-Finally..!

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.280
TV is not working again.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.980
I'm missing out on Lord Rama's Swayamvar dear.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.600
I think the problem is upstairs.
Shall I go take a look?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.660
Go fix it fast.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.160
Uhh..grandma called me ma'am..

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.160
..for cable repair..that's why I came..

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.040
Uh..excuse me..your name..?

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.380
Akhila dear!!

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.400
Akhila!

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.740
Why did you call me?

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.740
Aunty is calling you.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.840
Akhila..

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.580
Is it working grandma?

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.000
Yes, it's working.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.940
-Ok.
-Repair is done right? You can leave..go!

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.140
No grandma..signal is already weak.
If it gets disconnected again, you'll feel bad.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.380
-I'll leave after the program is done.
-Ok sit.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.480
Have you seen this anytime?

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.160
-What grandma?
-Have you seen his program anytime?

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.160
Yes grandma..

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.760
Look at how adoringly Lord Rama
is looking at Sita..

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.740
-Are you watching it?
-Yeah..yeah..

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:58.140
-Look how beautiful Goddess Sita is..
-Really grandma?

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.080
If you keep looking at them,
you'll be blessed for life..

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.520
Hey dear, believe in god from this age itself..

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240
Hey, dear..

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.960
-Yeah grandma..
-If you watch this kind of programs,
you'll be blessed.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.520
True grandma, we'll be blessed..

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.180
Bro, he left me at 3'o clock bro..

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.240
He said 30 minutes...

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.040
It's 6 and he didn't come yet..

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.340
Here, have some..

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.200
B-O-A-T..BOAT. Natya, remove pencil
from your mouth and write.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:35.360
They have shown Sita's swayamwar
in Ramayana beautifully!!

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.700
When Sita looked at Rama for the first time,
then only she fixed that he is her husband.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.100
How great-

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.260
-Power is gone..
-Yay! Power is gone..

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.620
-He'll always cut the power in a perfect moment.
-[children shouting]

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.260
-Shut up both of you. Aunty, I'll get a candle.
-No need to do homework..happy!

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.400
-Yeah get it..
-I only won..I only won..

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.460
-No, I only won
-Akhila..

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.520
..I'm getting candles.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.560
Dear, Is the power gone only in our house
or in the whole colony?

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.120
We're vexed with this..

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.800
Akhila..

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.320
Will you read in candle light? It'll hurt your eyes.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.320
I have an exam tomorrow grandma..

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.860
I have to prepare compulsorily..

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.260
-Dear..
-Yeah grandma..

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.480
You repair TV right..take a look if you
can fix the power issue also dear..

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.460
My granddaughter has an exam tomorrow
it seems..she has to study.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.880
-Power only right, grandma?
-Yeah dear..

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.060
I'll be right back..

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.900
I know that we are not gonna sleep tonight.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.400
-Hey Bujji..
-Yeah..

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.880
-Do one thing bro..
-What else do you want?

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.880
-Tell..
-Go back and sleep bro.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.180
Bro, are we really going to stay here
the whole night!?

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.700
Looking at her...I wish this moment
would freeze forever...

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.700
<i>I've asked my eyes..</i>
-Bro, wake up..

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.420
<i>to imprint your frame..
</i> That girl bro. Shit! she saw me bro...

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:31.580
<i>they've countered..by showing everything as you..
</i>

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.600
<i>I've asked my heart..</i>
-Hey, throw the ball..

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:34.700
Put it there...

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.480
<i>to not let go of you..
</i>

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:44.080
<i>I've realized then that my heart is not with me..
</i>

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:50.700
<i>Let this moment freeze as it is..</i>
-Who gave these? -Amar got them aunty..

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.980
<i>My life is not enough...</i>

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.520
<i>if I keep looking at you...</i>
-Hello grandma...Yeah, coming grandma..

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:02.540
<i>Let me love you like this until my last breath..
</i>

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:08.580
<i>Even if I die, I'll become your breath and
will stay until your end..
</i>

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:14.580
<i>You are my happiness, you are my sorrow,
you are my light & shadow..
</i>

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:20.820
<i>You are my past, you are my future,
you are my success & failure
</i>

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.220
Why is this guy staying here all the time?

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:38.700
Dad!

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:50.560
<i>When you are tired, I'll become your refreshment..
</i>

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:55.980
<i>I'll become a hand that calms your soul..
</i>

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.960
<i>I'll pat your back and stand behind you as a support..
</i>

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:08.800
<i>I'll braid your hair and scold you with proximity..
I'll become your mom..
</i>

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.180
Grandma...

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.340
Happy Birthday to my Akhila dear.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.740
I know whose wishes will make you really happy.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.200
Once you complete IAS this year...

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.880
everything will be alright then..

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.140
My darling..

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.720
Grandma, don't tell to anyone that it's my birthday.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.320
I'll not. Go take a head bath...go.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.220
Come..

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.500
Happy Birthday dear..

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.200
God bless you my dear...

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.440
Who sent this?

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.500
Akhila..

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.120
That's me..Akhila.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.020
You sent flowers to yourself..

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.740
..and you're acting all innocent. Very interesting.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.160
I did not order this.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.120
I don't want these flowers.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.680
Please take it ma'am. My manager will scold me again.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.780
Please ma'am, I'll lose my job, my salary will get cut..

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.640
I'm just a salesperson ma'am. Please take it.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.640
Give it..

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.120
Hey, go dude. You are always scared..

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.060
-Bro, go fast...Go!
-You don't understand..

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.700
She looks very beautiful dude.

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.860
-I know that already..keep quiet.
-You finally accepted the truth.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.680
-Oh my god! I can't do it. I'm going bro..
Bro, why are you leaving in the last moment?

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.040
-Why is he coming back?
-What is he doing?

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.280
This fellow..!!

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.660
Where is it? I can't find it..

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:37.880
What's this?

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.600
For whom?

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.740
I did not order this.

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:49.900
Ma'am..

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.260
On the occasion of our Cake castle's anniversary..

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.700
..every year we send out birthday cakes
to 10 people from our lucky draw.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.260
In this year's lucky draw, your name turned up.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.880
I've never been to Cake castle.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.080
You don't need to come..

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.480
..but someone you know could've put
your name and birthday in our Kinderbox.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.740
Today is your birthday only right ma'am?
Please take it ma'am.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.440
-She took it.
-Yes!! She took it bro.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.900
Akhila, what's this?

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.820
Sister, cake!!

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.180
-Cake? I want it..
-Hey, wait..

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.060
-Who are these people?
-[Birthday song]

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.780
Akhila, is it your birthday?

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.260
Akhila, is it your birthday?

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.380
Aunty, who are all these people?
Are they Akhila's friends?

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.700
They are singing good, right?

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.380
They've planned a very good surprise...

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.440
Why is Grandma calling?

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.860
Yeah tell Grandma..

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:19.840
This is Akhila..

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.320
Akhila!?

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.740
Akhila? Shh..shh..Ok..talk talk..

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.300
Yeah, Akhila?

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.320
-I have to meet you..
-Ok..

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:31.220
-Tomorrow morning, institute bus stand.
-Ok..actually-

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.600
Akhila is asking me to meet her tomorrow...

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.400
Thanks for calling me ma'am.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.180
I've been waiting for this moment...
since a very long time.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.440
Shall we go to some coffee shop and talk?

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.580
First listen to what I'm saying.
Don't disturb me in the name of love.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.100
I asked you to come to convey this only.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:07.040
Akhila, wait Akhila!

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.480
Akhila, please stop once. Listen to me..

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.100
Akhila, you are my life Akhila...

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.100
I hate you.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:20.620
Leave me alone.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.940
Akhila, I'll change as per your likes.
I'll do anything for you Akhila.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.740
Whatever you do, I'll not like you.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.580
Akhila, tell me one reason...

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.740
tell me one reason for not liking me..I
'll not show my face to you again in this life.

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.820
I don't need to explain it to you..

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.240
You can't tell Akhila.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.900
My love is true, there is no selfishness in my love.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.400
I can't understand what your problem is Akhila.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.680
Akhila I don't have a future without you Akhila.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.660
I'll wait forever for you Akhila.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.320
Can't you understand if I tell you once?

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.260
I'll...never love you.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.120
Not only you..I won't love anyone.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.100
I don't have space for love in my life...

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.980
You can't live without love Akhila..

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.820
Not only you, no one can live without it.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.480
Love is an emotion in everyone's life Akhila.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.160
You should love someone too..

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.420
Yes..

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.260
Even I loved someone..

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.780
But that's not love...

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.460
As far as I'm concerned, Love means...

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.700
My dad..

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.680
Because..

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.120
Dad's smile...

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.400
Dad's tears...

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.500
Dad's sadness..

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.440
Dad's anger..

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.560
and even dad's hatred..

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.460
..is because of the love he has on me.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.880
I am his happiness...

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.340
I am his breath...

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.640
I am his existence...

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.800
I am his world...

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.500
..and even I love him the same way.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.580
I got a good rank in EAMCET.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.440
Why are you rejecting such a good college?

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.720
Do you know how tough it is to get admission
in that college.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.260
Mom! Four years away from you!?

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.360
Don't try to butter me...I know it's
because of your father.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.040
-Parvathi...
-I can't change both of you.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:24.080
-My Dad can't even live for a second
by sending me that far.
-Do whatever you guys want.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.880
Even I can't live without him.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.140
..he can't live without his daughter.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.060
That's why, even though my mom doesn't like..

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.060
..I joined engineering in Kakinada.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.680
What's your name?

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.620
That's where Sandeep saw me.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.400
After few days, he proposed to me.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:47.760
What?

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.300
I didn't know if I didn't like Sandeep or his love...

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.100
As usually I told this to my dad.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.420
I don't know if my dad thinks that
nobody can love me like him...

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.960
or if he is afraid that he may loose me..

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.000
You are not right for Akhila,
neither Akhila for you..

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.160
Dad didn't like Sandeep.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.340
But Sandeep didn't stop loving me.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.660
He wandered around me like that for three years.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.680
Whether it is out of pity that he was behind me for three years...

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.480
or infatuation...

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.320
or Love..I don't know..

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.080
Fathers are generally like this only.

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.760
They won't like if someone proposes
to their daughter.

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.000
They are very possessive.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.140
Keep me aside..

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.560
You informed to your father about every
single guy who proposed to you, right?

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.500
Has your father accepted at least one guy?

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.480
See, the problem here is..

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.560
I love you more than your dad does..

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.940
And he doesn't like that. So, he doesn't like me?

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.640
I don't care about all that Sandeep...

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.900
If you love me..

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.500
..go convince my dad.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.620
I will convince him..but first you get convinced.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.980
Then not just your dad..I'll convince
the whole world.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.140
At that moment..

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.320
I said yes to Sandeep..

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.540
They say Love is blind.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.300
I don't know how an year passed by after
falling in Sandeep's love...

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.760
My happiness..

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.180
My likes..

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:21.960
All my dreams...

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.380
..have become Sandeep.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.160
Exactly at that time..

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.840
-Aunty..
-My aunt's family..

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.280
Why are you late?

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:37.320
..brought a marriage proposal with their son.
-Uncle!!

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.800
Just like engineering final exam,
it was a final exam for my love.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.720
Should I marry someone I don't like for my dad..

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.060
..or should I marry Sandeep as my heart says?

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.120
My dad rejected Sandeep's love..

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.940
Why would he agree for my marriage
with Sandeep then?

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.980
At that moment, dad called me..

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.840
-My aunt, her son and everyone is
waiting for me at home.
-How long will it take for you?

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.080
I'll soon be there dad.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.760
Yeah, come fast dear.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.480
Yeah..ok..

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.540
Everybody is at home..

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.180
If I go home now..they'll fix my marriage with Arjun.

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.740
I don't know what to do.

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.860
For the first time in my life..

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.420
without informing my dad..

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.200
far away from him..

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.320
Let's go & get married...

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:37.470
Where am I going?

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.360
-If we get married your dad can't do anything
-Why am I doing this?

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.520
..ignoring all these I left with Sandeep.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.040
I was feeling really sad for leaving without
informing my father.

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:53.460
How can I leave my dad, who loves me a lot and
who can't even live a second without me?

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.980
What would happen to my dad once
he knows about this?

00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.060
All these thoughts..

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.600
..didn't let me stay at that place at all.

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:08.140
I tried convincing Sandeep that we should marry
with my dad's approval..

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.340
If we don't get married tomorrow, it'd never happen.

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.020
-Your dad won't let it happen.
-He didn't agree with me.

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.300
I tried convincing him.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.120
He didn't understand.

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.480
It led to an argument..

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.740
Your father is trying to blackmail
you emotionally.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.940
I couldn't resist when he ill spoke about my father.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.280
-Why are you worried about that old prick now?
-I slapped Sandeep in front of everybody.

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:28.360
He couldn't take it.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.260
I know it's my mistake..

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.120
But he didn't even try to understand why I did it.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.860
-Go to hell.
-That moment..

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.160
..Sandeep left me and went away.

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.780
Sandeep couldn't bear...that I slapped him.

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.340
At that time..

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:58.420
..he didn't understand my emotions or my anger.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.180
Then I realized...

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.000
..if its so easy to break-up,

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:07.420
then it isn't love at all.

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:12.180
Thinking it's love..the terrible mistake that
I did leaving my dad behind..

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.080
..I'm aware of it.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.080
Since childhood..

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.100
my dad brought me up giving a lot of freedom,
that I never had to lie.

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.140
Even then, accepting Sandeep's love
against my dad's wish,

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.780
not informing him about my love,

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.960
going with Sandeep leaving him behind..

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.420
-my dad couldn't bear all these things.
-He loved you more than his life...

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.900
How can you even think of cheating him..? How?

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.980
I can understand how much he is heart-broken
because of me.

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:53.640
I wasted 21 years of my life by showering
my love on you.

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:56.800
Dad...

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.780
-Now I don't even want to show my anger towards you.
-Dad..

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.140
-Dad... Please dad...
-You are nothing to me.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.080
-Dad... Please dad...
-Don't call me like that.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.540
I don't have a daughter.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.360
That's why I decided to live my for my dad.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.600
But my mom wanted to get me married
and send me away.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.620
Mom..

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.980
I don't want to get married.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.880
I'll prepare for Civil services.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.900
By achieving his dream of me
becoming an IAS officer...

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.000
I wish to win back my dad and his love.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.820
Once I made a mistake, thinking that it was love.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.580
By the time I realized that it was not love...

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.320
I lost everything.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.660
Nobody can love me like my father.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.640
That's why I don't believe in love.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.420
Never...

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.380
Everyone's love is not the same.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.860
Unlike what you think, my love is not fake
like Sandeep's.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.960
After listening to your story...

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.720
I feel my love is nothing compared
to your father's.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.540
The love your father has towards you...

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.400
and the pain he goes through by being
away from you all this long...

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.580
Your desire to get back to your dad..

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.220
and the suffering you are going through
by being away from him..

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.400
I can understand...

01:01:59.120 --> 01:01:59.860
So...

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.340
I have decided not to disturb you anymore.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.860
I already wasted a lot of your time.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.840
I won't waste your time anymore...

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.500
You will never see me again.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.820
Don't get upset bro..

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.120
Sometimes these kind of things happen in life...
and it'll make you cry..

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.760
What's wrong with you buddy?

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.280
Even though she revealed her past to you..

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.280
..how can you leave her just like that?

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.240
Does this mean...you left Akhila for good?

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.420
There is no such thing as quitting in love.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.580
Once you start loving..

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.400
..you just keep on loving.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.900
-So you didn't stop loving her yet?
-Nope..

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.500
I said I won't disturb her..
I didn't say I will stop loving her.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.340
Why are you leaving so soon?
Are you done with the workout?

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.060
That girl is working damn hard to become
an IAS officer for her father

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.860
Can't I at least sell books for my dad?

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.480
I too have a dad..and I too have an emotion.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:35.440
<i>The paths that I've walked beside you
came to an end..
</i>

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:44.820
<i>Even if I've moved aside, I stayed at the same place..
</i>

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:53.400
<i>Your memories that are filled in me..
are my new friends..
</i>

01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:03.060
<i>Stay like this as a world in me..reminding me of you..
</i>

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:09.820
<i>Even if you are not in front of me..
even if we got separated..</i>

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.620
<i>your place in my heart never vanishes..
</i>

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:18.880
<i>It doesn't let you know..it doesn't melt inside..</i>

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:24.100
<i>the distance we've gone apart..is not a burden..</i>

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.200
What happened to this cable guy?

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.880
He used to come as soon as I gave a call...

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.380
Now we don't even know what happened to him...
and he's not answering the calls too...

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.080
See you grandma...

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.540
Bhaskar, consignment should be delivered
by Monday at any cost.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.760
I already sent them dad.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:11.080
<i>My heart should get used to every second
without you..
</i>

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:15.830
<i>Let me teach myself that life should go on
like this..
</i>

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.640
Bujji, what happened to Amar?

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.060
He's not meeting us these days..

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.360
He's mostly staying at book store now-a-days..

01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:29.560
<i>I've grown inside like a directionless wave
in a stream..
</i>

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.550
<i>I'm spending my time with you,
who is beside me but not in my reach..</i>

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.840
This TV is not working again...

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.120
and that Amar is not answering calls.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.860
Why do you need TV at this time mom? Let's go...

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.020
Can't you take leave just for today and
come to Srisailam with us?

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.780
Not possible grandma.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.460
-There is a very important class at institute today.
-Ok.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.580
Be careful.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.640
What's this dear? Your body is so hot..
Have you got fever?

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.180
I will take tablets grandma.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.340
I will be fine.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.460
Looks like you've got fever.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.140
What are you doing here?

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.980
Yesterday when you fell down unconscious...

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.560
I only brought and joined you here.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.900
How..How did you bring me?

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:03.960
How means..?

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.080
I carried you and put in the auto..

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.540
then again I carried you to put you on the stretcher...

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.340
then the nurse moved you on to the bed.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.520
You carried me!!?

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.200
Without my permission, How...how can you touch me?

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:18.600
I tried to take your permission ma'am...

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.060
I nudged you...but you didn't get up.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.760
So I carried you.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.900
You could have sprinkled water on me, right?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.040
It wasn't necessary ma'am.
You were already soaked in rain.

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.700
You could have called my family members right?

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.480
I came there only after they called me..

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.820
It's true ma'am.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.200
You didn't answer the phone at home...

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.940
and your neighbors didn't answer either...

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.220
So who is the idiot that's available all the time?

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.320
Me...That's why I'm here..

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.100
You did all this on purpose.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:44.960
Me?...

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.840
Inducing fever in you or controlling the
temperature in sky or rain

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.760
I don't have the talent to manage these things yet.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.580
Still if you don't like me bringing you here...

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.460
try to get back your fever again...
go sleep in the rain.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.280
Here...it's your grandma.

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:02.440
Talk to her.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.500
How are you feeling dear?

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.540
I am fine...

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.980
I don't get it why you don't keep
your phone with you.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.000
Yesterday we called you all day and since you
didn't answer we were scared and called Amar.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.120
Poor guy! He even came amidst heavy rain.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.560
You never listen to me.

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.800
Don't be scared, we are on our way.

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.240
Speak to your uncle.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.460
I am fine uncle.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.380
-Ok, be careful..
-Ok..

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.300
Take tablet dear.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
How do you feel now?

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.780
Grandma.. I'll go to institute from tomorrow.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.380
-It has already been three days.
-No dear...

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.420
Doctor advised you to take rest for 10 days right?
Take rest.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.100
-Only three months are left for exams grandma..
-Listen to me dear.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:07.000
You are my sweet heart right? Study from here only...

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.820
Who's going to suffer if you get sick...Tell?

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.100
It's not that grandma...

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.500
-Are you fine grandma?
-What fine dear?

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.260
Here..she keeps talking about classes only..help her.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.380
-Did you bring notes..?
-Yes

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.980
-Did they teach Geography in class today?
-Yes.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.240
-What's this?
-Laptop

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:33.840
Dongle..

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.580
Dongle?

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.880
Thanks to this, my burden of bringing notes
to you daily will be solved..

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.700
and your problem of not attending classes
will also be solved.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.360
Here..keep this phone with you.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.840
No grandma.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.720
Keep it dear. You are not feeling well right?

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.200
If this is with you, I won't be worried.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.780
Take it dear...

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.620
Are you completely recovered?

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.160
-I should thank you only.
-For what?

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.400
For talking to Shekhar sir and convincing him
for online classes..

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.400
I didn't speak to him...

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.720
Then who spoke to him?

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.360
He asked me not to tell you about this.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.580
How is Amar related to this?

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.960
When you were sick...

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.540
Amar only spoke to Shekar sir and
convinced him for online classes.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.040
Why did you take his laptop without informing me?

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.180
Immediately...

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.920
Return this laptop to him...

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.480
He is a good guy.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.040
Say thanks to him once..

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.320
-Hey Bujji...
-Yeah..

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.640
These girls..

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.960
never trust those who truly love them.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.880
They only trust those who cheat them
in the name of love.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:22.840
Yeah..right bro.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.260
All girls are like that only.
Even Akhila is the same, right?

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:27.140
She lost her dad for falling in love once bro.

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.400
She thinks it'd happen again if she falls in love..

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.780
Logical, right? That's why she doesn't wanna love again...

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.960
She loved some jerk but..

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.020
rejected you, who truly loves her.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.240
Akhila is not like all girls bro.
She's different

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.180
Even after her father said that she's dead to him...

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.180
..she came this far for him and his dream.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.500
She isn't even sleeping well at night or
eating food on time.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.160
Look at how hard she is working bro...
I promised her that I won't disturb her.

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.520
Otherwise..

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.350
<i>Even if the world changes..</i>

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.580
I can't even stay for a day without seeing her.

01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:01.480
<i>it's a character that never changes..
</i>

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:09.860
<i>It crosses light & shadows...
and reaches you as a friend..
</i>

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:14.340
<i>Even if you hate it, it'll love you back..</i>

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.300
<i>letting go of it's selfishness...
</i> -Whenever I think of her...

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.870
<i>It'll forgive you for whatever mistakes you do..
</i>

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.960
..my heart tears apart bro.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.910
<i>standing beside you forever..
</i>

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.760
I'm just pretending to be happy bro..

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.790
<i>It's a truth that's beyond your imagination..
</i>

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.940
but the suffering I am going through inside..

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.080
no one knows.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:43.990
<i>It doesn't have any limits..there's no end to it..
</i>

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.600
Sometimes I feel like..

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.040
..death is better than this.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.320
Ok. Our stop has come..let's get down.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.080
I spoke a lot unnecessarily..do you think she heard it?

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.360
Rest of these..?

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.120
Sir..where should these be delivered..?

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.700
-Send them to Vishwa IAS Institute.
-Ok sir

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:28.300
Dad! Viswa IAS!?

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.800
Yeah..Do you know it..?

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.500
He seems to knows about it take him along with you.

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:33.340
-Ok, let's go sir.
-Dad...!

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.500
Just go along with him.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:36.900
-Hey Bhaskar..
-Sir..

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.580
That girl studies at this institute only.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.920
Now if she spots me here...

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.920
..she won't believe even if this
institute is my dad's.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.700
Why sir?

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.800
I promised her that I won't go behind her and
disturb her anymore.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.840
You are getting scared unnecessarily sir.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.460
If she studies in this institute,
shouldn't we come here?

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.340
Nothing will happen.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.920
In case if she spots you, just call me and
I will talk to her.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.920
-Make it quick Bhaskar.
-You stay here only sir..

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:29.800
Let's leave..

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.120
-Akhila
-Yeah grandma..

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.280
Here..this seems good.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.180
-Is that Amar?...Amar
-Why did grandma come here?

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.360
-Bro, stay in line...
-[calls out] Amar-u...

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.840
-I'll call you again
-What are you doing here?

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:57.960
-Shall we go?
-Mom...

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.160
Mom...she is grandma..

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.060
-Namaste
-Her grand daughter, Akhila.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:11.920
I called you so many of times,
why don't you answer your phone?

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.740
-That grandma..
-Have you stopped working as a cable operator?

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.460
Cable operator?

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:20.720
Not just a cable operator, he does electric work,
brings water cans, vegetables for everyone...

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.000
Especially he helps so much in our house...

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.040
Don't know what happened recently,
he stopped coming.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.120
My son is like that only. Since childhood
he is very workaholic.

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.140
-Mom...let's leave
-Wait..

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.040
You're right only..He is truly a workaholic.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.260
Once when my grand daughter was feeling sick,
we weren't home.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.820
When we got scared and called him...

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.160
He immediately went, joined her in hospital
and stayed with her all night.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.220
If you get to know him once..you just can't leave him.

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.560
You'll love him a lot.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.500
-Mom let's leave now..
-Wait dear..

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:48.960
Let's leave..

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.100
-By the way, where are you from aunty?
-Kakinada.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.820
Kakinada! Even we are from Kakinada.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.860
Jagannadha Puram councilor...is my uncle.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.300
That councilor!? He is our distant relative also.

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.380
-Is it!?
-We got close so quick...

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.120
We have become relatives, right dear?

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:08.400
-Right dear?
-Mom please mom..let's go.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.920
Amar..You should bring your mom to our house once.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.540
-For sure grandma..
-We will definitely come.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.500
You also should come to our house tomorrow.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.660
We have Satyanarayana Vratam at our house tomorrow.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.220
-Mom...
-Come along with Akhila aunty...

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.720
-You should definitely come.
-We will...

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.200
You bring them..ok? Akhila, come dear...

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.580
Come on Akhila, let's go.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.780
-Akhila...you should definitely come.
-Mom...why are you inviting her to home?

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.900
-Why do you do like this mom?
-What happened now?

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:32.540
What bro? Are you worried that she won't come?

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.220
Not that she won't come bro...
I am worried that she would.

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.160
You should have seen the over action my mom did
yesterday in front of her..

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.860
I am scared how much she reacts if Akhila comes now.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:47.340
By the way, Where is Bujji?

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.640
This fellow is scared that the girl is gonna come..

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.580
..that fellow is scared that granny is gonna come.
So he didn't come.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.400
She should not at all come today bro..

01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.080
-I don't know what's gonna happen..
-Bro, she is here!

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.340
-Hey, yeah bro..
-Hey lucky boy...enjoy

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.600
You are over bro.

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.200
I'll be back guys..

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.000
-Please come in.
-House looks good..here keep this inside.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.960
-Hi aunty..how are you?
-Madhu..

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.720
-I have seen her somewhere..?
-She is Akhila.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.980
-Namaste uncle
-She is our...

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:21.740
-You remember Shekhar uncle..?
-Yes..

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.440
-She is a relative to them.
-So she is our distant relative.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.600
What distant relative? She is a
close relative to us.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.800
Come with me Akhila, I will show you our house.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.660
-Grandma, give this in prayer room please.
-Who is this girl?

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.660
-Hey, come here.
-She is our relative.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.900
-Come here...
-I'll come wait dad.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.160
-I said come here..
-Dad..?

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.140
I think I have seen her at our bookstore..

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.980
-Not possible dad. I will be back.
-[calls out]

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.100
I am sure I saw her then...

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:47.500
I wonder what she is doing here now..

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.760
-It's nothing dad..wait for 2mins, I'll be back.
-Hey come here..

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:53.020
-Priest couldn't find our home..
-Dad can't you send someone else..?

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.840
I will look after her..you go bring him home.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:01.060
Why are you feeling shy? This is our house only.
Come..

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:09.300
Sit here..

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:10.880
Sit..

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.400
This is Amar's room.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.620
Don't feel uncomfortable at all.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.540
When Pooja is about to start I will call,
then you can come.

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.780
Shall I switch on the AC?

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.380
I will be back.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.000
<i>I've loved you so much that...</i>

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.380
<i>for your happiness, I sacrificed my love...</i>

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.400
<i>I've lost you..but..</i>

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.640
<i>not the love that I have on you...</i>

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.220
<i>My love is...'Immortal and Universal...'</i>

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:32.700
Hi Sister!

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.700
I should not call you sister right?

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:38.100
Ok..leave that aside. Let's go out first..come..

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:42.700
You were sitting alone in the room. right?
So I thought we can have a chat in the balcony.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.700
Mom said it may take a while..

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.180
Can I ask you a question?

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.420
Do you...like my brother a lot?

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.500
Or...

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.300
Does he like you a lot?

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:05.720
My brother only likes you a lot.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.640
You are very lucky.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.020
Hey Chinni.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.180
What are you doing here? Mom is calling you..go.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.160
Actually..I'm not at all involved in
inviting you to this pooja ma'am.

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.480
Coming to the institute then..

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.060
..joining you in the hospital when grandma called..

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.180
even my mom inviting you..

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.520
all these happened without my involvement.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.580
If you can bear these few hours,

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.180
I will try my best not to enter into your life again.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.160
In case..if my mom..

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.460
or Chinni gave you trouble..

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.620
Please forgive...

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.200
I am really sorry ma'am.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.820
I think the pooja has begun..

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.400
it would be nice if you can sit there.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.380
Please come..

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:48.000
Why aren't you answering my calls since morning?

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.540
Is it?

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.600
What happened?

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:22.820
Akhila phone...

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.340
Akhila!

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.900
Your dad called you..

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.560
Mom might have called from dad's phone.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.500
Not your dad..?

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.920
Dad doesn't know my number.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.440
Okay..bye.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:07.480
Amar...

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.740
Did you just call me with my name?

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.920
Actually..I don't have any class.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.760
Can you take me to coffee?

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.920
<i>A promising musical note..
</i>

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:28.420
<i>A devoted blessing..
</i>

01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:34.020
<i>You've touched me..
</i>

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.820
<i>Like a flutter in my heart..
</i>

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.620
<i>You've just started..
</i>

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.700
<i>Love has opened doors for me..
</i>

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.140
2mins..I will be right back..okay?

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.020
Guys..

01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:00.340
-She is here.
-Akhila!?

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.980
Don't do any over action.

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.980
-We don't have any relationship between us. Please.
-Ok..

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.140
-She is waiting outside..I will bring her in.
-Ok ok...

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.420
Coffee tastes good here...I'll get it?

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:30.920
<i>Are you my dream...or
Are you a truth that my eyes have found..
</i>

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:37.260
<i>Are you my heart beat..
Are you a miracle that I've never experienced..
</i>

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:43.700
<i>Are you my story..
Are you the childishness that won my heart..
</i>

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:50.040
<i>Are you a binding pulse..
Are you a struggle without my permission..
</i>

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:56.460
<i>You are a sweet play that deviates my path..
</i>

01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:02.160
<i>You are a temptation that changes my behavior..
</i>

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:09.120
<i>This new relation that follows me like my shadow..
</i>

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:14.880
<i>You've shown me my destination..
</i>

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.360
<i>My heart is filled with Love..
</i>

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.420
<i>This strange feeling is Love..
</i>

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.720
<i>This world is full of Love..
Only Love..
</i>

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.500
<i>A promising musical note..
</i>

01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.020
<i>A devoted blessing..
</i>

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:05.260
<i>You've touched me..
<u></i></u>

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.480
<i>Like a flutter in the heart..
</i>

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.300
<i>You've just started..
</i>

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:18.420
<i>Love has taken it's shape..
</i>

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:24.560
<i>You are the answer to my question of 'Who I am'..
</i>

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:31.340
<i>The life inside me stands as the proof..
</i>

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.540
<i>When my new life has asked for it's purpose.</i>

01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:43.540
<i>This world has shown you to me..
</i>

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.620
What's up?

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.800
Don't you have any class?

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:51.400
Today..it's a holiday.

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.220
Are you free?

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.080
Actually, I have some work. But it's fine..go ahead.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.660
I want to go out.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.680
If you are free..

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.580
Shall we go?

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.920
Out?

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.400
Okay, where do you want to go?

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.520
Is that okay?

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.600
Ok. I will come. Bye.

01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:34.200
<i>You are a temptation that changes my behavior..
</i>

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:40.560
<i>This new relation that follows me like my shadow..
</i>

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:46.320
<i>You've shown me my destination..
</i>

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:52.860
<i>Are you my dream..or
Are you a truth that my eyes have found..
</i>

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.640
<i>Are you my heart beat..
Are you a miracle that I've never experienced..</i>

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.280
Aunty, I kept your clothes in your room.

01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.400
Nothing aunty..

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:18.360
You look beautiful.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.580
Since you came, I've always seen you with books
and never in front of mirror?

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.340
This dress suits you well.

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:53.320
Dear...drink milk.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.100
Why are you crying dear?

01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.340
-Nothing...
-Did you remember your dad?

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.340
Nothing grandma.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:45.660
Grandma?

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.640
What are you doing here grandma?

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:50.080
Akhila was crying all night.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.740
Has anything happened with her dad again...?

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.920
Then what's the problem grandma?

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:57.940
You only...

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:01.720
Me..?

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:03.240
What have I done grandma?

01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:04.160
You loved her.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:08.820
You loved her so much that
she couldn't resist loving you back.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.300
That was long back grandma..
when I didn't know about Akhila's past.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:15.200
After I knew, I kept all my feelings
and love aside grandma.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.020
She is not able to put aside dear.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.540
I don't understand what you are saying grandma.

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.740
If she gets close to you...

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.640
she'll loose her dad permanently.

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:34.160
If she looses her dad, she can't be happy.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.000
Akhila loves her dad a lot grandma.

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.200
She would never loose her dad because of me.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:47.120
There might have been a little disturbance
because of me but..

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.980
She would never forget her target grandma.
You don't worry grandma.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.660
Akhila will definitely pass IAS.

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.340
There won't be any disturbance because of me grandma.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:57.960
What happened?

01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.800
You never turned up yesterday..

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.960
It's fine..you might've been studying and forgot.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.140
I thought of telling you an exciting news,
If you had made it.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.560
What happened? You are not even
reacting to the exciting part?

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.940
I got a job in Bangalore

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.100
I am leaving tomorrow.

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.400
What do you mean?

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.100
You thought I could never get a job or what?

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.720
No...It's not that. Why Bangalore?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.940
You can find a job in Hyderabad, right?

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.400
Getting a job itself is a big thing for me..
on top of it choice of location?

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:35.520
Stop joking..

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.940
Should you leave tomorrow itself?

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.720
Yeah, I must...

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:46.000
It's better to leave as soon as possible, right?

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.180
Tell grandma..

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.900
-that I got a job..
-Grandma?

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:58.300
She would feel very happy if she knows that
I got a job and settling in life.

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:02.800
Didn't your mother say anything when
you said you're leaving?

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.680
My mom? I told her..

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.940
actually...

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.080
She is super excited.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.740
Ok bye, I can't travel with you anymore.

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:24.660
My stop has come. I need to get down.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.880
You should study well, become an IAS officer..

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.680
and come in Newspaper. Bye then..

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.360
-Dad, I want to go to Bangalore.
-Why Bangalore?

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.940
I will stay with Uncle in Bangalore and
get a software job.

01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:13.300
You have your own business and
why do you need a job?

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:16.180
For how long..should I keep selling books dad?

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.440
What are you talking?

01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.380
If you don't have respect on my work...

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.060
You don't have respect on me also right?

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.260
Then why do you need my permission?
Leave.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:37.330
<i>Even if my step is fumbled..
</i>-What is this all of a sudden?

01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:38.120
I need to go mom.

01:37:38.130 --> 01:37:40.980
<i>Even if it misses its pair and lands someplace...
</i>

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.680
<i>Love doesn't let go of you in my heart..
</i>

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:51.220
<i>Even if the truth is marred..
</i>

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.580
<i>Even if my world is changed to darkness..
</i>-Dad...

01:37:54.580 --> 01:38:00.260
<i>Love never loses it's sanctity..
</i>-I'm leaving dad...

01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:14.180
<i>If you are not with me...will I stop loving you?
</i>

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:28.060
<i>Love means..loving forever...</i>

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.130
<i>As you are flying towards your destination...
</i>

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:58.020
Give it to me aunty. Akhila!

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.320
<i>Every moment my heart...
</i>-Are you doing good mom?

01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.300
<i>..wishes for your success</i>

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:17.860
<i>For the dream you wish to achieve, I drifted
apart from you...leaving my soul alone...
</i>

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:24.620
<i>Seeing you flying in the sky,
I've stopped myself on the land..
</i>

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:32.180
<i>Being a sacrifice, as a witness for your love...
</i>

01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:45.900
<i>If you are not with me...will I stop loving you?
</i>

01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:59.320
<i>Love means..loving forever...
</i>

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.880
Forget about the past...listen to me

01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:06.440
Talk to her...

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.440
Mom, I will listen to whatever you say..

01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.760
..but please excuse me in this issue.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.380
What happened dear?

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.320
Why are you crying?

01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:35.180
-Tell me..
-What happened dear?

01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:40.140
Tell us what happened dear...

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.420
I've passed...IAS mom...

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.420
I know that you will do it dear...

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.060
My sweet heart...

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.260
Your hard work has paid off...

01:42:55.260 --> 01:43:00.180
Your daughter has passed IAS...
She's going to become collector...

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.940
Dear, Akhila got a good rank in IAS exam..

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:23.440
What are you doing?

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:27.380
She passed the exam and is going to become an
IAS officer..why aren't you saying anything?

01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:29.120
Can't you say something?

01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:32.500
I am hungry, serve me food.

01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.500
Akhila got a good rank...

01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:37.900
[sternly] I am hungry, serve me food.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.540
-Akhila dear..
-Don't cry..

01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:58.280
You know about your dad, right?

01:43:58.460 --> 01:43:59.700
You are my darling right?

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.700
It's ok dear. Don't feel bad...

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.380
-Grandma...
-Amar...

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:18.900
How are you grandma?

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.440
I'm fine dear, how are you?

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.040
I'm fine grandma. Akhila passed IAS right grandma?

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.240
Is Akhila happy?

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.160
Is her dad speaking to her?

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:30.980
No dear..

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.700
He hasn't changed..

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:35.880
..and he won't.

01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:58.800
Hey Arun Prasad!

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.080
When are you giving party for us?

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.500
For what?

01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.160
What do you mean for what sir? Your daughter is
an IAS officer now right?

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.080
You don't need to work anymore sir.

01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:09.460
Wherever your daughter gets posted..
just go settle with her.

01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:12.300
What else do you need sir? You have become
father of an IAS officer.

01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:15.820
If Akhila gets posted here, please
help me with my transfer sir.

01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:17.580
I have been trying since five years.

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:31.720
Here..

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.340
I decided to get her married.

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.940
Marriage?...With whom?

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:43.940
Arjun..

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.060
After what happened, if we ask them again,
it may not be nice..

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:50.760
I already spoke to my sister.

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:53.520
Is it enough if you and your sister decide?

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.520
Won't you ask her opinion?

01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:58.860
She worked hard a lot and passed IAS for you.

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:00.800
She is your daughter!

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.880
I don't want her to be my daughter anymore..

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.280
that's why I fixed this marriage.

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:09.020
I'm tired of everyone around me
reminding me that she is my daughter.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.540
So I've decided to get her married
and send her away.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.620
That's it..

01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:15.800
It's not because she is my daughter
or my responsibility...

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.180
Stop speaking rubbish!!

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:21.020
Through divorce, wife and husband
may get separated..

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:23.140
..but blood relation never gets separated.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.700
Do whatever rubbish you all want to do...

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.420
but I won't agree to this marriage at all
until she approves.

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.000
I like this marriage dad.

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:40.200
Mom..

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:44.120
..don't get involved in this issue anymore.

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:47.600
Sister...

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:50.640
..we thought 16th is a good day right?

01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:53.460
I am thinking about planning the
engagement on that day.

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:54.660
What do you say?

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.280
Okay then..bye.

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.260
I'm telling the truth..

01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:05.260
..even if you agree to this marriage, I won't.

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.460
I will talk to Lakshmi and Arjun and stop this marriage.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:14.160
If dad likes it..then I like it too grandma

01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:17.320
Is this an IAS exam to write if your dad likes it?

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.060
This is marriage!! Your life.

01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:27.120
I already made him suffer once..by rejecting
the proposal he brought.

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.280
Have you lost your mind?

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:38.120
Have you thought about what would happen to your
life and future if you accept this marriage?

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.200
If dad thinks that...my marriage is with Arjun...

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.120
then that's my future.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:47.940
Then what about Amar?

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.620
I know everything dear.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.820
For asking him not to disturb you ...

01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:03.900
and not to let you loose your dad's love..

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.240
For asking him once...

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.580
He sacrificed his love and went away.

01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:14.880
I got a job in Banglore..I am leaving tomorrow.

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:20.180
Bye then, I can't travel with you anymore..

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:24.560
Leaving someone who loved you so much..

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.700
why do you love your dad so much who wants to
get rid off you by getting you married to someone?

01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.300
Tell me the truth..

01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.760
Didn't you love Amar?

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:54.420
I didn't want to...love him grandma.

01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.120
Amar..

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:03.840
..loved me so much that I couldn't
resist loving him back.

01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:08.720
Amar...taught me how to love.

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:15.120
He also taught how to let go off love...

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:18.400
Even if there's no one in my life..

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.100
I want dad to be there...

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.060
This marriage..

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.900
..should happen according to dad's wish grandma.

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:33.260
Promise me you won't say this to anybody grandma..please..

01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:56.700
Dad...

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.060
unknowingly...

01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:03.260
I did a big mistake in my life dad.

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.420
Before I realized the mistake I did...

01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:12.420
I lost you dad.

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.140
From that moment...

01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:22.060
I have been constantly trying to
make it up to you dad.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:27.000
All these days...

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:32.080
I only felt sad...for staying away from you.

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.040
But now..

01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:43.580
I am scared that I could never...make it up to you.

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:49.620
I'm not able to bear this dad.

01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:57.940
I'm neither saying this to make you agree that
I didn't do any mistake nor...

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:05.760
to convince you to forgive me
for the mistake I did.

01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:10.900
If you ask me 'why I went away?'...

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:13.980
I don't have any answer dad...

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:17.860
But the reason I came back..

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.260
..is you dad

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:22.460
your love...

01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:26.240
For your happiness..

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.680
I'd do anything.

01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:31.400
Dad...

01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:34.440
I want to say something to you...

01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:41.040
I am sorry dad..I am sorry for everything.

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.500
-Are you the one waiting for me?
-Yes sir.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.360
I've never seen you in this college...

01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:38.560
Which group do you belong to?

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.080
I am not a student sir...

01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:43.080
I am Akhila's friend sir.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.600
Just friend sir.

01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:49.980
-I'm getting late for my class.
-You still have three minutes for your class sir..

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:54.360
Akhila told me about you and
your relationship with her.

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:58.740
She told how much you like her and
how much she loves you sir.

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:00.760
Compared to your love..

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.220
I felt every other love is weak sir.

01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:06.560
For that love only sir, she wanted to
become an IAS officer.

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.340
Everybody thought she worked hard for IAS...

01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:14.840
but actually...she wrote exam...
to win back your love sir.

01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:17.440
She worked hard and wrote the exams but...

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:21.480
...she lost in winning your love sir.

01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:24.940
I don't care why you are saying all this to me..

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:33.440
You hated Akhila not because she
went away with someone...

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.060
but because she went without saying to you.

01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:44.140
Should she say everything to you sir?

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:46.200
Please think once sir...

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:48.200
'Why did she leave at all?'

01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:50.040
'and for whom she came back?'

01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.040
You should've asked this once sir.

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:55.980
First of all, how did so much love
turn into hate sir.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:01.000
Since she backed you, he left Akhila...

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.380
and since she went away with him,
you pushed her away sir.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:06.900
Then what's the difference between
you and him sir?

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:11.160
He couldn't understand what Akhila did in rage...

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.380
and you couldn't forgive her for what
she did out of innocence.

01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.920
Love means..

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.000
loving their weaknesses too...

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:22.460
and forgiving their mistakes also sir.

01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:27.320
You still have one minute for the class,
right sir?

01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:32.500
They say..there won't be any selfishness
in true love sir.

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.120
True love bears sir..

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:37.120
True love tolerates sir..

01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:39.540
True love forgives sir..

01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:42.760
I've read this somewhere sir..

01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:50.400
Your love has everything sir..

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.200
..why leave out that forgiveness alone sir?

01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:01.580
I think it's time for your class sir.

01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:03.480
Thank you sir. Good bye.

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:16.120
Good morning brother.

01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:17.860
Hi Keshava...when did you come?

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.680
Morning..Gowthami express.

01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.040
-Are kids doing good?
-Yeah..

01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:23.380
You woke up a bit late I think..

01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:25.920
Brother..

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.420
I am very very happy.

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:33.620
Arjun likes Akhila a lot since childhood.

01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:37.460
But brother, Arjun lives in Australia..

01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:39.820
and Akhila will get a posting here, right?

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:41.460
-So..
-Excuse me..

01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:44.520
You would've already thought of everything.
Yeah, coming..

01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:45.800
Take a bath brother..

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:48.120
-Catering people are here..take a look.
-Ok..

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:50.060
-Has Arjun and family started?
-Yeah..

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.540
-How much time will they take?
-Maximum half an hour.

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:15.980
Yeah... that's true.

01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:20.160
Arun... next week is auspicous it seems.

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.540
We will get them married.

01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:24.140
There is still three months time for
Akhila's training right?

01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:27.640
After marriage, Arjun wants to take Akhila
to Australia along with him.

01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:28.700
What do you say..?

01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:32.680
-What do you guys say?
-That's why he's getting her married..

01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:34.200
-Hey, is that ok?
-Yeah, ok dad

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:36.500
-Then start doing the visa-work.
-Yeah sure..

01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:50.800
Put this saree on and come quickly...

01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:00.620
Why are you sitting here? Everybody is waiting
for us..come quickly.

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:10.580
-Hello ma'am...How are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?

01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.660
-I'm fine.
-Where is your husband?

01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:13.860
He's inside. Please go..

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.900
Now you are father of an IAS officer.

01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:27.320
It was once your dream to become an
IAS officer, right?

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:31.400
When our children fulfill our dreams,
we will be much more happier.

01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.200
By the way, Why are you so dull?

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:35.460
I get it..

01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:38.500
For your daughter to sleep ten minutes more...

01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:40.880
you changed school timings itself..

01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:43.440
I mean you have tried..
Do you remember?

01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:45.440
Whenever I remember that, I laugh a lot.

01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:48.060
And now, you are getting her
married and sending her away?

01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:51.440
I thought you would bring an in-house
son-in-law. Really..

02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:34.120
A royal salute to the IAS Officer.

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:37.820
Great dear...

02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:42.100
I've seen sadness in your father's eyes..
for sending you away.

02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:44.260
Don't know how he's gonna survive from tomorrow.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.340
Even you can't live happily by staying away
from your father right?

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.720
Why are you so dull?

02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:55.060
Don't you like the groom?

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:05.140
I will definitely come to your wedding. Ok?

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.400
Dear...

02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:56.560
What happened dear?

02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:02.760
Mom said..after I grow up, you will get
me married and send me away..

02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:07.480
Are you crying for that dear? Silly girl..

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.100
Mom was just kidding...

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.680
Will I send you away?

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.160
No chance at all..

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:13.780
I won't even get you married..

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:17.980
Even if I did, I will ask that guy only
to come here and stay with us.

02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:18.920
Ok?

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.040
Promise dear...

02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:37.080
Come fast...

02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:06.540
Dad...

02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:08.300
Dad..

02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:15.240
I've made a mistake dear..

02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:23.840
I thought of punishing you, but I punished my self dear.

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:30.340
I want to get her married and send her away, that's it.

02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:33.680
It's not because she is my daughter or my responsibility.

02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:38.780
Loving means...

02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:42.620
to love their flaws and weaknesses too.

02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:45.020
Loving means..

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.440
forgiving. Loving means...

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:49.080
loving forever...

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:52.260
That love was dead to me..

02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:55.100
and changed into anger and hate in me.
That's not love dear..

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:56.140
It's poison...

02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.900
-Dad..
-About this..

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.160
he won't even be half my age..

02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:06.380
until he said this to me I haven't realized dear.

02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:08.580
I started thinking from that moment.

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:10.360
When I thought about it..

02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:12.180
you left dear..

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.720
For choosing him over me..

02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:16.860
I pushed you away...

02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:19.900
Since you didn't leave your father..

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.220
..he left you.

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.680
What's the difference between his love
and my love dear?

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.040
There is a flaw in my love dear.

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:31.800
My love is filled with selfishness.

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:32.580
Ego..

02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:35.440
That's why I couldn't forgive you dear.

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.900
But you are not like that, your love is
not like that.

02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:42.580
You even loved my hatred and my anger too dear.

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.660
You taught me also how to love dear.

02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:46.620
Sorry dear...

02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:48.700
Sorry..

02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:54.580
I've made you cry enough all these days..

02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:58.600
Stop dear...

02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.520
I am asking you now, tell dear..

02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:07.660
You agreed to this marriage for me only right?

02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:12.440
I...like this marriage dad.

02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:13.600
Akhila!

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.440
Shut your mouth!

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:19.780
-Mom?
-She doesn't like this marriage...

02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:27.580
You said a guy who is less than half your age
told you about love right, Amar..

02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:32.140
She loves him...

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.040
'Loving means...

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:41.420
loving forever', he didn't just say this to you..

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:43.200
he did it and showed it to us.

02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:48.340
Just because I asked him not to separate
father and daughter's love..

02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.340
he left his love and went away.

02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:55.740
For eloping once and hurting you..

02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:00.380
even though she doesn't like it, she accepted for
this marriage not to loose you again.

02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:08.720
Your love and my love is nothing...

02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:11.320
when compared to theirs.

02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:13.320
That's true love.

02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:18.940
Dear?

02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:41.300
-Sit..sit..sit please
-What are you doing here sir?

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.060
You saved me from making...a very big mistake.

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.800
It's very easy to forgive the mistakes
of people we hate sir...

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:55.360
but it's very hard to forgive the mistakes
of people we love sir.

02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.820
I can understand sir.

02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:59.320
Mom told me everything.

02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:04.480
I wanted to get Akhila married to someone
who loves her as much as me...

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.400
but I found someone who loves her more than me.

02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:15.400
Speak with Akhila...

02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:43.220
Amaram..Akhilam..Prema

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:47.760
Forgive me sister.

02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:51.020
I have troubled you a lot.

02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:54.580
I can't give my daughter to you...
Please forgive me sisiter.

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:56.080
What is this brother?

02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.960
She's my niece..

02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:01.240
if she gets married to my son or not..she is my niece.

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:05.780
If she is happy only right?...we all can be happy.

02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:09.640
Thanks a lot for understanding sister.
Thanks a lot.

02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:11.640
-Akhila serve these to everyone..
-Hey Amar

02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:13.920
-You also eat dear
-You also eat...

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.620
Kids should eat first right?

02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:24.480

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:41.920
What dear?

02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:43.540
When I asked what kind of a boy he is..

02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:46.480
-you said he is a good one.
-Yes..he's a good boy only...

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.210
About that...

02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:49.860
Shouldn't good boys love...or get married?

02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:36.080
-Hello, dear...
-How much longer?

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:38.460
All of us should look very good....

02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:41.240
-This photo is going to stay with us for life long...
-Grandma, if you keep quiet, I'll take the photo...
